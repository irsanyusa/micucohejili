"When a patient is assessed to require further evaluation or testing, we are able to see them in our clinics if they are in our service area or connect them with a testing facility in their area."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>According to its <a href=# id=c2ba3304-58d8-36aa-a5b0-9faae5611c56>website</a> , the company's free Coronavirus Assessment Tool is "based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines." You do not have to be a Carbon Health patient to get tested, nor do you require a doctor's order.</p><p>The online tool asks patients to answer a series of questions that will help determine if they need further screening to address their risk of COVID-19. The tool is free and "leverages Carbon Health's technology to systematically assess patients using the latest CDC criteria," according to the <a href=# id=c1c6b35b-29a9-3a79-a20e-52f0bfee3e94>website.</a> People will need to either log into their Carbon Health account or create a new one and provide their name, gender, birthday, email address, telephone number, and a government-issued ID to use it.</p><p>After the assessment, which can take at least 3 to 6 days according to the website, Carbon Health will determine if a patient is a candidate for COVID-19 testing.</p><p>"If the provider believes the COVID-19 test is appropriate for you after your free virtual screening using the Coronavirus Assessment Tool, we will perform a physical evaluation, conduct the collection onsite, and send the specimen to either Quest or LabCorp depending on your insurance," reads the company website.

There are two in San Francisco: one in the Castro and one in the Financial District. The startup competes with the likes of One Medical and Forward, though it doesn't charge subscription fees and is often cheaper. One Medical and Forward are <a href=# id=9e6ce88a-9745-3f25-a69f-d14053973aaa>also offering testing</a> for the virus.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Test kits for the coronavirus are in need across the country and in California the number of confirmed cases in the state hit 740.

Only patients that are invited can be tested at the sites, according to <a href=# id=647064a7-741f-336f-a10a-35db87991abb>KPIX5.</a> As of Tuesday, the 2 sites had completed 320 tests collectively.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>SEE ALSO: <span id=f281d52e-7aae-374e-a659-f8d28dfe323e>Photos show what San Francisco looked like the day before residents were ordered to 'shelter in place' for 3 weeks to contain the coronavirus</span></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p7056aoWejnrmqr86nZK%2BZnKGyunnHnpilrJiYrrOxjKyrmqqkqr1ur8CrmaimXZ2yorjToWSiq12ks6ex0aKloGWTpL%2BwusCvoKuto2LBpr%2FToqWgZZGpfHeF1qGvo6U%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mormon-halloween-party-bans-cross-dressing-costumes.html><span>←</span><span>Mormon Halloween Party Bans Cross-Dressing Costumes</span></a>
