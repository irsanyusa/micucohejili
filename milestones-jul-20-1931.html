Excerpts:</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Those who will not be interested in me after my marriage will be insignificant in number. … It wasn’t sex appeal over the radio, it was just musical ability. . . . I’ve just signed a $150,000 contract for the coming year. Does that look like lessened popularity?”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“He is just an ordinary man to me.”Acquitted.
