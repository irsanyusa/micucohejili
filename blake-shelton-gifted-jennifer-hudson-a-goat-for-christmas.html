Hudson brought up the Christmas gift that the country singer gave to her and her son which is indeed unexpected. What brought up the gift was Hudson’s son David, 13, who asked Shelton if he could get them a goat. Shelton laughed at the request and said it was appropriate because he was “the country guy,” but humored David nonetheless.</p><p>“I remember at some point I asked you I said, “I really want to get him a goat for Christmas,” Shelton said. “So I got him a pygmy goat, but the season was over and I wanted to see y’all so I had to like, get an airplane to fly this frickin’ goat from Oklahoma to Chicago.”</p><p>After getting the goat a first-class plane ride, the Hudson’s certainly got a big surprise to see Shelton at their door with a goat in hand. The mother and son named their new pet Prancer, and that made it one of the most memorable Christmases they’ve had.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Shelton Has a Holiday Tradition of Cooking a Dome Shaped Dish Made of Pasta With his Wife</h2><p>The Voice coach also revealed during his guest appearance his holiday traditions and activities with his wife <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gwen Stefani</a>.

There’s heaven inside of it. There’s all kinds of stuff and it’s so good,”&nbsp;Shelton said.</p><p>The last original coach on The Voice went on to describe the dishes that are the result of his wife’s cooking process.
