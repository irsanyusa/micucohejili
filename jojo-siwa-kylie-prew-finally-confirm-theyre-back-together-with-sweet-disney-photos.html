It’s none other than her previous girlfriend, Kylie Prew. After publicly breaking up during <a href=#>Dancing With the Stars</a>, this young couple has confirmed the rekindle of their romance.</strong></p><p>People have been dying to know who Siwa is dating since her “not single” announcement in March. The <a href=#>So You Think You Can Dance</a> judge managed to keep her fans guessing until May 5. She confirmed her relationship status with Prew in an adorable Instagram post. Within the photo, the women have their arms around each other and Siwa is kissing Prew’s cheek. Ahead of the confirmation, this couple had been sharing their day together on Instagram stories.</p><p>“If you love something let it go, if it comes back….” Siwa <a href=#>wrote</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CdMC_BTJM-S/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><p>All fans of JoJo Siwa are happy to see her back together with Kylie Prew. This couple originally met while on a cruise and hit it off instantly. They began as friends and soon after began dating.</p><p>Prew was one of the first people to find out about Siwa’s sexual orientation and was the person she was dating when she came out. They originally began dating in January 2021 and stayed together for almost a year before splitting in November 2021.</p><p>Their split came during Siwa’s time on Dancing With the Stars, where fans noticed Prew’s absence in the audience. After tons of TikTok based speculation, Siwa <a href=#>confirmed</a> the rumors in early November. At that time she explained that while they were not romantically involved, they were still best friends.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jojo-siwa-recently-hinted-at-getting-back-together-with-kylie-prew>JoJo Siwa Recently Hinted At Getting Back Together With Kylie Prew</h2><p>Many fans knew that Siwa and Prew got back together during the celebrity’s “not single” confirmation. While admitting that she was seeing someone exclusively, she continually used the phrase walked around the block. While this is just an expression of growth, fans saw the meaning of her returning to Prew behind it.</p><p>In a recent <a href=#>So You Think You Can Dance</a> interview, Siwa acknowledged a key detail that led fans to believe this confirmation was coming. The detail was Siwa saying she’s currently in a long distance relationship. As many fans know, Prew is from Florida, but lived in California for a large portion of their relationship. During the interview, she was directly asked if she had gotten back together with Prew. Even though she denied the rumor, she totally blushed and avoided contact all together.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/AGT-lawsuit-2.png alt="5 Shocking Times ‘America’s Got Talent’ Was Sued" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>JoJo Siwa</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>so you think you can dance</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yaihqGWjnsSiecqyo6KdXaW%2FpsOMn6CnmZyhxm6vzqedoqqdYsGpsdirnGaakZi4bsDOoJytoJWneri106FkrK%2BVmsFusMispZ6xXaW1sMDOrGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./0-26174-1948865-00-html.html><span>←</span><span>Friday, Dec. 18, 2009 - Quotes of the Day</span></a>
