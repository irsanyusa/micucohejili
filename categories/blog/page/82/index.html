<a href=../../../../japan-tourism-seafood-restaurant-high-prices.html></a>
Booming numbers of foreign visitors to Japan are driving up prices at restaurants near tourist spots, as a weaker yen makes the country a bargain destination and local wages struggle to keep up with a broader rise in costs.
Emblematic of this is the ¥6,980 ($46.52) sashimi-topped rice bowl at&nbsp;Toyosu Senkyaku Banrai, a new retail complex in Tokyo’s Toyosu area. It’s made with fresh seafood from the adjacent fish market, which was moved from the famed Tsukiji auction building in 2018.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Etat et rgions s'entendent sur un partage des rles</h2><time>Jun 5, 2024</time>

<a href=../../../../fda-hold-public-hearing-gaming-drug-industry.html></a>
The Food and Drug Administration will hold a public meeting&nbsp;next month to investigate ways that federal regulations can be manipulated by brand-name drugmakers to&nbsp;impede&nbsp;generic competition&nbsp;from entering the market.
The hearing, scheduled for July 18, is the latest step taken by newly installed FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb to have the agency take a more active role in policing drug prices.
“We know that sometimes our regulatory rules might be ‘gamed’ in ways that may delay generic drug approvals beyond the time frame the law intended, in order to reduce competition,” Gottlieb wrote Wednesday in a blog post announcing the upcoming meeting.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Gunpowder: True Story Behind Kit Harington HBO Miniseries</h2><time>Jun 5, 2024</time>

In 1605, a group of British Catholics, including Guy Fawkes and Robert Catesby, devised a plan to blow up the Houses of Parliament. They hoped to wipe out the anti-Catholic political establishment and with it King James I, a protestant who introduced strict laws that persecuted Catholics, including the banning of priests.
However —spoiler alert — the plot failed when a group of guards decided to check the cellars and found the conspirators hiding there, moments before they were to set the plan in motion.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How Loneliness Can Make You Vulnerable to Extremism</h2><time>Jun 5, 2024</time>

“You’ve got to harvest seeds for whatever food you want to eat so that you can grow your own,” the woman at the register told me. She went on to explain that she had heard all the grocery stores are going to close thanks to some combination of COVID-19, inflation, and social unrest, so she was growing her own food to survive when America becomes, in her words, a “free-for-all.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../../categories/blog/page/81/>← Prev Page</a>
