Poles are big fans, but Western Europeans tend to be scepticalFather’s Day is a time for children and adults alike to let their fathers know how much they mean to them. But are people prompted to say thank you to their patriarchs by the spirit of the day itself, or because they are being bombarded by companies telling them to express their affection through the medium of buying things?
A new YouGov survey in 18 countries and territories shows a mixed picture regarding Father’s Day.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Le projet de loi Formation sera prsent le 22 janvier 2014</h2><time>Jul 31, 2024</time>

A recent slew of situations resulting in catastrophic violence and death, including the Israel-Gaza war, the armed expansion of the Islamic State, the downing of a Malaysian Airlines plane in the Ukraine, the ongoing conflict in Syria, and also the spread of the Ebola virus, has led to a renewed debate as to what kinds of imagery media outlets should be expected to show.

Ferguson remains jazz’s greatest, most charismatic trumpet virtuoso, even at age 70. He can still play arabesques at double-high-C, but he now uses his incredible technique and rich tone more expressively. And at a time when jazz ensembles struggle to survive, his small but versatile big band, Big Bop Nouveau, now in its ninth year, plays nearly 200 mostly sold-out gigs annually. Ferguson’s stature and nurturing generosity have long attracted talented young musicians, but this exceptional group really cooks with revitalized standards (Just Friends gets a swinging, brassy treatment spiced with a fugue) and exciting new compositions, including the tuneful, scintillatingly played Waltz for Nicole and a lovely ballad, Milk of the Moon, that displays Ferguson’s romantic side.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>My Husband Insisted That I Dont Clean the Fridge in His Absence, I Did It Once and Found Out a Cr</h2><time>Jul 30, 2024</time>
