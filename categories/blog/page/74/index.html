A spice commonly used to make curry couldhelp the brain heal itself by encouraging the growth of nerve cells, according to a new study.
Researchers at the Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine in Julich, Germany, found that rats injected with aromatic-turmerone, a compound found naturally in turmeric, showed increased activity in parts of the brain associated with nerve-cell growth.
The compound could encourage the proliferation of brain cells, researchers said — though it was unclear whether it could be used to help stall or reverse the symptoms of degenerative-brain diseases like Alzheimer’s or dementia in human beings.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Judges Save Gargoyle from Elimination</h2><time>Jun 16, 2024</time>

Columbia Pictures Action figures promoting an action movie are a pretty basic merchandizing technique, particularly when you’re Quentin Tarantino. The director has had such collectible tie-ins made for each of his films, according to the&nbsp;Associated Press. But recent uproar over Tarantino’s&nbsp;Django Unchained&nbsp;toys shows that the basics don’t always work.
The&nbsp;Django edition of those&nbsp;toys may have been intended somewhat ironically—yes, Django has action-movie qualities, but the bloody take on slavery is no&nbsp;Transformers—but if the people behind the toys had thought things through a little more, the irony might have taken on another level: it’s not hard to see why somebody might be offended that eight-inch versions of the movie’s enslaved characters are available for purchase for $39.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How Much Money Does Wladimir Klitschko Make?
