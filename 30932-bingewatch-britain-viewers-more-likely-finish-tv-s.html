Viewers more likely to finish a TV series if its released all at once</h1></header><section class=post-content><h3>As more streaming services experiment with moving away from the “binge-watch” model, three in ten Britons say they’re more likely to complete a show when every episode is released at the same time - versus just 17% of those who watch weekly</h3><p>In 2013 Netflix released every episode of House of Cards at once – fundamentally changing the way many people consume TV and motivating many other providers to follow their example. But it’s not a model that has been a success for every series or every streaming service: there have been arguments that the “binge” structure limits the buzz around certain shows and can even ensure they “disappear from the cultural conversation” <a href=#>earlier than they would otherwise</a>.</p><p>With Disney+ using a week-to-week model for The Mandalorian – and with Amazon announcing that Season 2 of The Boys will transition towards weekly episode releases – it’s worth exploring how viewers feel about the way that TV shows are delivered to their living rooms.</p><p>YouGov Daily data indicates that those who have access to a series all at once are more likely to complete it: three in ten (31%) believe the binge model is more conducive to finishing a show than the week-by-week model – with 17% believing they’re more likely to get to the end of a series that’s released week by week.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Streaming20piece.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>When those who don’t mind how a series is released are combined with those who are more likely to complete shows they watch all at once, they amount to more than seven in ten (73%) viewers. What’s more, there’s evidence to suggest Brits actively favour TV series that make every episode available at the same time.</p><p>According to a YouGov Daily poll from September 2019 most (52%) would rather have access to a show that releases every episode at once compared to 38% who want to watch shows on a week by week basis. Our data indicates that the public certainly make enough time for binge watching TV: 55% of Brits watch more than 10 hours of TV a week, and three in ten (29%) watch more than 20 hours.</p><p>So streaming providers may have to strike a delicate balance between giving the majority who favour binge watching what they want – and extending the longevity of their content, which may have more opportunities to build an audience and a cultural conversation when episodes are released on a weekly basis.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Sign up for YouGov Daily</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkwaavx6empaeXrnyivtOimqWdo2SAcYWSa2SboZ6csrit05yfZpqinsGitc1mraKdp5q%2FtHnMqKmeZZyeuKa42GadoqaZqLVuwNVmqg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./16-times-disney-fans-found-easter-eggs-in-their-favorite-movies-806293.html><span>←</span><span>16 Times Disney Fans Found Easter Eggs in Their Favorite Movies</span></a>
