He also reinvented some of his most popular songs with a symphony orchestra on Symphony of Hits in 2019.</p><p>The new album features uplifting and inspiring songs, which Bolton was inspired to write during the Covid-19 pandemic. It’s also the first album of his career on which he was involved in writing every song.</p><p>“I felt a responsibility to help people feel a spark in their lives. Music is very powerful that way,” he says. “We’re all so humanly connected; we’re so in need of some light,” Bolton told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Billboard</a>. “That became the working theme every day: ‘How do we make [the music] make other people feel better?’”</p><p>Spark of Light features 10 new songs including the title track, as well as “Just the Beginning” and “Beautiful World” featuring Justin Jesso.</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WHY ON EARTH ARE SUPERSTARS LIKE JEWEL, MICHAEL BOLTON COMPETING ON ‘AMERICAN SONG CONTEST’</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bolton-is-excited-to-perform-the-songs-live>Bolton Is Excited to Perform the Songs Live</h2><p>Bolton currently has several <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class=broken_link>live performances</a> lined up into next year.
