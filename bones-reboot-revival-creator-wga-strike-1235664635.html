But with a streaming era that has made reboots and revivals more popular than ever, could “Bones” ever come back?</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">According to the show’s creator, there is hope.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“We are in contact with each other,” <a href=# id=auto-tag_hart-hanson data-tag=hart-hanson>Hart Hanson</a>, who created “Bones,” tells Variety. “Everybody on ‘Bones’ is in contact with each other. At separate times, it’s like, ‘What are you doing? What’s the availability?’”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Speaking to Variety at the <a href=#>“Bones” reunion WGA picket</a>, Hanson spoke about the realities of reviving the show, noting the very different media landscape today compared to when “Bones” aired on Fox from 2005 to 2017.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“It’s complicated now because Fox broadcast ‘Bones,’ but Disney now bought 20th, so they own [the show]. It would take a million agents and lawyers to figure out who owns what and what platform it would show on,” Hanson said. “But we do keep talking. And every once in a while, we are all nostalgic enough to think, ‘Maybe we should do it again.’ Who knows? Maybe this will bump-start us.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Executive producer Stephen Nathan stepped into the conversation, chiming in, “It is odd that everybody is still in contact. It was a great group of people.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“It was a happy place to work,” Hanson added. Hanson and Nathan were among the crowd of former writers and producers from “Bones” at the <a href=#>WGA picket</a> outside the Fox lot in Los Angeles. They were joined by the show’s star, <a href=# id=auto-tag_emily-deschanel data-tag=emily-deschanel>Emily Deschanel</a>, who also picketed to show support for the writers on strike.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I could see it. I could see it,” Hanson said of a possible revival. “Of course, it all depends on David and Emily. Without both of them, no.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Bones” starred <a href=# id=auto-tag_david-boreanaz data-tag=david-boreanaz>David Boreanaz</a> as FBI Agent Booth and Deschanel as Temperance “Bones” Brennan, a forensic anthropologist. The show remains Fox’s longest-running scripted drama series of all time.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">When asked if they’ve spoken with Boreanaz or Deschanel about the possibility of a revival, Hanson said that they would be open to the conversation.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“We have heard that they would not not be game, which is a step,” Hanson said. “The actors are going to say the truth, which is it depends on what it is, the scripts, what it looks like, if it feels right. They’re not going to do something just because it’s us.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">With a laugh, Nathan quipped, “But we don’t have to do it for 12 years again, do we?”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiukae2psDYZ5qopV9nfXN%2Fjq2taKaVrMBwrs6nnKxlopqvsLvTZqmerpmrrq15wqucmqyfp3q4s8Bmqq2qmaCybn2RbGxvbmRrgHZ7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./top-10-richest-people-in-africa-mid-way-into-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Top 10 richest people in Africa mid-way into 2024</span></a>
