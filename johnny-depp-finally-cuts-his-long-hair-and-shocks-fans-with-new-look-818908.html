He shared this moment with Maïwenn, his co-star and director, and showed off his charm by taking photos and signing autographs for his admirers.</p><p>On stage, Depp shared his feelings of <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>being</a> “strangely, oddly, perversely lucky” for getting to play King Louis XV, saying, “So you realize that you’ve come from the bellybutton of nowhere, and suddenly you end up playing the King of France.”Love him or hate him, you can't deny that Depp knows how to keep us all talking. Whether it's on the screen or the red carpet, he's always got something up his sleeve.</p><p><h2>His new haircut got the fans talking.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/639/aff/784d6c59388ae971ca69e8c6fb.jpg><p>Johnny Depp’s recent shift to a shorter hairstyle has been the talk of the internet. The consensus among fans is rather mixed.</p><p>Some fans expressed relief over his "improved" appearance. One fan <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>remarked</a>, “He has been looking unhealthy for a while. I’m glad he’s past that now.” Many believe the new hairstyle rejuvenates him, as another fan noted, “He looks so much better with short hair. It makes him much younger.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/020/4bb/3cb3e25b9aaf483634610f84e5.jpg><p>Not everyone was singing praises of Depp's look. One person harshly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, <i>"He looks like he hasn't washed his hair since the trial,"</i> casting a shadow over his fresh look. Another voiced concerns over signs of aging in Depp’s appearance, hinting that his past lifestyle choices might be visible.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/108/c38/6bc3035a01bce3c2bfc9e26ac9.jpg><p>Another celeb who recently made waves for their new look is <a href=# title="Keanu Reeves" data-link=tag>Keanu Reeves</a>, who just like Depp, chopped off his long hair. <strong>See his photos </strong><a href=#><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLewtM2nsGaclaW9brLIp5ilpKlisLbA0mafoqtdobyvs4yhmKKqXZa7pXnSoaaco6Nis6K60mauoqyYYrumw4ylpqijXW1%2BeYWPcWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1594969-john-dumelo-engaged-altercation-voting-centre-ug-campus-video-trends.html><span>←</span><span>John Dumelo Engages In An Altercation At Voting Centre On UG Campus, Video Trends</span></a>
