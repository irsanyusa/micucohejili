Up&nbsp;until one moment when a&nbsp;seemingly innocent object helped her to&nbsp;reveal a&nbsp;shocking truth about her husband of&nbsp;5&nbsp;years. The desperate lady wrote a&nbsp;letter to&nbsp;our editorial and told her story, which had an&nbsp;unbelievable and least expected twist at&nbsp;the end.</p><p><h2>The relationship between the spouses has always been smooth, but one thing added a&nbsp;weird tone to&nbsp;it.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/922/422/2a55ff5ab8adf67513103b27ed.jpg><p>A&nbsp;woman named Stephanie, 32, has written a&nbsp;letter to&nbsp;our editorial and told&nbsp;us her story. The woman wanted&nbsp;us to&nbsp;publish&nbsp;it, and she wanted her experience to&nbsp;serve a&nbsp;warning for other people to&nbsp;pay attention to&nbsp;any weird stuff that’s happening in&nbsp;their <a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a>.</p><p>Stephanie began her letter, saying, «I&nbsp;and my&nbsp;husband Mike have been happily married for over 5&nbsp;years now. We’re a&nbsp;typical family, with no&nbsp;significant problems or&nbsp;scandals, that would make&nbsp;us stand out from the crowd. But since the very beginning of&nbsp;our married life, my&nbsp;husband Mike has been having a&nbsp;very weird demand for&nbsp;me. He&nbsp;insisted that&nbsp;I should never clean our fridge while he’s absent.»</p><p>Stephanie explained that of&nbsp;course she has been curious about the reasons for her husband insisting on&nbsp;her cleaning the fridge ONLY in&nbsp;his presence. She said, «He&nbsp;has never mentioned that&nbsp;I shouldn’t, for example, clean the bathroom or&nbsp;wash our car, whatever, while he’s absent. The only thing he&nbsp;was so&nbsp;persistent about, was our fridge. When I&nbsp;asked him about his motives for this strange behavior, he&nbsp;mumbled something like he&nbsp;didn’t want me&nbsp;to&nbsp;throw away <a href=# title=food data-link=tag>food</a> that we&nbsp;can still eat, and he&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;keep this process under his control just because of&nbsp;this.»</p><p>Stephanie knew that her husband was just finding excuses, and that he&nbsp;wasn’t telling her the truth. She said, «I’ve never had a&nbsp;habit of&nbsp;throwing away food, and&nbsp;I always check the expiration dates on&nbsp;the packages. If&nbsp;the food is&nbsp;expired, I&nbsp;won’t of&nbsp;course keep it&nbsp;any longer in&nbsp;the fridge, but&nbsp;I believe this is&nbsp;something that all normal people&nbsp;do, because who wants to&nbsp;consume expired products?»</p><p><h2>Mike was extremely protective of&nbsp;some stuff in&nbsp;the fridge, urging his wife to&nbsp;never touch&nbsp;it.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/07f/21b/37855256db866817f026fa2cbe.jpg><p>Stephanie recalled how Mike once brought home a&nbsp;metal box that he&nbsp;carefully placed in&nbsp;the fridge. He&nbsp;used to&nbsp;check on&nbsp;it&nbsp;often during the day, which was really strange. When Stephanie asked him about&nbsp;it, Mike explained that it&nbsp;contained some olives of&nbsp;a&nbsp;rare kind that his friend James got from his granddad as&nbsp;a&nbsp;present and wanted Mike to&nbsp;keep for some time.</p><p>Stephanie explained, «I&nbsp;had no&nbsp;problem with Mike keeping this metal can safe at&nbsp;the bottom of&nbsp;our fridge. But he&nbsp;was really annoying, because he&nbsp;always asked me&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;cautious with the can and to&nbsp;never open&nbsp;it, as, like he&nbsp;said, it’d be&nbsp;rude to&nbsp;touch other people’s stuff.»</p><p>Stephanie added that this can of&nbsp;olives had been kept in&nbsp;their fridge for many years now, and no&nbsp;one has ever claimed&nbsp;it. James never came to&nbsp;pick them, and Mike has never said anything about when he&nbsp;was actually going to&nbsp;give him the thing.</p><p><h2>One day, Stephanie decided to&nbsp;break the rules and cleaned the fridge when Mike was away.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c56/922/7998f859b3b478c87d7b911a7a.jpg><p>Stephanie goes on&nbsp;with her story, saying, «Last month, I&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;clean out the fridge while&nbsp;I had some spare time. Mike was at&nbsp;work, urgently completing his monthly plan, and&nbsp;I decided that I’d make some small violation of&nbsp;our family agreement and clean the fridge while he’s away.»</p><p>The woman started this ordinary procedure, and she didn’t even suspect that this step would mean the end of&nbsp;her happy marriage and the crash of&nbsp;all her hopes and plans.</p><p>The woman said, «The whole thing took me&nbsp;about 2&nbsp;hours, including unplugging the fridge, emptying all shelves and putting away all items (groceries, some vegetables and food containers with pre-cooked dishes). I&nbsp;then started washing and cleaning out the inside of&nbsp;the fridge, and then&nbsp;I let it&nbsp;settle before plugging it&nbsp;in&nbsp;again. During this time&nbsp;I started sorting out all the items that&nbsp;I took out of&nbsp;the fridge before cleaning, checking the expiration dates on&nbsp;the packages and throwing away those that were off. I&nbsp;took the box my&nbsp;husband brought and checked the dates on&nbsp;it, too. I&nbsp;noticed that the olives were expired, so, without a&nbsp;second thought, I&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;throw it&nbsp;away, too.»</p><p>Stephanie explained that, besides the expiration date, she noticed that the container with olives was leaking, and it&nbsp;looked like it&nbsp;was dangerous to&nbsp;consume these olives anyway. So&nbsp;she didn’t even think of&nbsp;the consequences, except for the potential risk of&nbsp;this food to&nbsp;be&nbsp;further stored in&nbsp;their fridge.</p><p><h2>Stephanie suddenly revealed a&nbsp;very unexpected thing about her dear husband.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d26/909/3af3485d7fb1a123d7b282284d.jpg><p>While she was bringing the can to&nbsp;the garbage bin, it&nbsp;cracked even more and the top of&nbsp;the can had almost fallen off. The contents of&nbsp;the can were spilled on&nbsp;the floor. Then, to&nbsp;her surprise and horror, Stephanie saw that those weren’t olives at&nbsp;all.</p><p>The woman wrote, «I&nbsp;saw some liquid pouring down on&nbsp;the floor from the can, it&nbsp;had some chemical smell. And then&nbsp;I saw what was stored in&nbsp;this liquid. These were 2&nbsp;small cuts of&nbsp;an&nbsp;umbilical cord. I&nbsp;knew instantly what they were, because my&nbsp;sister preserved the remains of&nbsp;her baby’s umbilical cord to&nbsp;keep it&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=memory data-link=tag>memory</a> of&nbsp;the day when my&nbsp;niece was born. She used to&nbsp;show them to&nbsp;me&nbsp;once or&nbsp;twice, I&nbsp;didn’t find it&nbsp;gross, or&nbsp;whatever, and&nbsp;I just knew how these things looked like, so&nbsp;I recognized them immediately.»</p><p>When Mike was back home from work, Stephanie initiated a&nbsp;talk with him immediately. She told him that the «can of&nbsp;olives» expired and was leaking, so&nbsp;she decided to&nbsp;throw it&nbsp;away. She revealed, «When I&nbsp;said this, Mike went pale. I&nbsp;asked him why he&nbsp;was so&nbsp;worried about this can of&nbsp;olives, and he&nbsp;said that they were very expensive, and so&nbsp;on. But I&nbsp;interrupted him, asking him a&nbsp;straightforward question about those umbilical cord parts that&nbsp;I found in&nbsp;the can. He&nbsp;had nothing left to&nbsp;do&nbsp;but tell me&nbsp;the truth, and it&nbsp;was shocking.»</p><p><h2>That day a&nbsp;mind-shaking revelation was prepared for Stephanie.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/615/226/dfdf3d53eda5cfb80cd53f0751.jpg><p>It&nbsp;turned out, that Mike had a&nbsp;love of&nbsp;his life, a&nbsp;woman named Rosa, with whom he&nbsp;had 2&nbsp;babies, who were twins. The babies were born when Mike and Stephanie were already married, and he&nbsp;kept it&nbsp;a&nbsp;secret from his wife all this time. These were the parts of&nbsp;their umbilical cords that Mike was storing all this time in&nbsp;that «can of&nbsp;olives» in&nbsp;their family fridge.</p><p>Rosa and Mike couldn’t get married or&nbsp;be&nbsp;together, because her family was totally against Mike in&nbsp;Rosa’s life. All this time, while he&nbsp;and Stephanie were married, he&nbsp;was seeing Rosa secretly from everyone and taking care of&nbsp;his two kids.</p><p>Stephanie wrote, «I&nbsp;was absolutely shaken to&nbsp;find out all this information from a&nbsp;man, with whom&nbsp;I have lived a&nbsp;big part of&nbsp;my&nbsp;life. I&nbsp;hadn’t even suspected that a&nbsp;can of&nbsp;olives would be&nbsp;the ’beginning of&nbsp;an&nbsp;end’ of&nbsp;my&nbsp;family life and a&nbsp;total disaster for my&nbsp;marriage. I’m filing for divorce and&nbsp;I can’t stop thinking of&nbsp;this huge betrayal from the person, whom&nbsp;I sincerely loved.»</p><p>And here’s yet another amusing life story from a&nbsp;woman who found <a href=#>a&nbsp;tampon</a> in&nbsp;her husband’s car. She then learned the truth she wished she never knew, as&nbsp;it&nbsp;made her hair stand on&nbsp;end.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6eceuqpuZnpl6qrrSoqqtnZRiwamt02agZpyfo8Fur8uemKdlpJ2ybrLRopugnV2eu260yKxkmpqjmruksYyiZJ2hlGK2tXnOp5qeZZGjsW6yzq6lnWWfqsFurYycqZ6doK56tb7UrZ9mmZKkwrV5x6KkZnBhbX96go4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./music-brass-attitude.html><span>←</span><span>Music: Brass Attitude | TIME</span></a>
