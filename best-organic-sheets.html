Whether you daydream all afternoon about slipping into freshly-washed sheets with a good book or you’re a “snooze as soon as your head hits the pillow” kind of sleeper, we spend a lot of time in bed. It makes sense, then, that shoppers are increasingly looking for pillows, duvets, and sheets made from organic materials. In addition to being more environmentally friendly, organic sheets are also a gift to your largest organ—your skin.</p><p>“Bedding is an important factor for skin health that often gets overlooked,” says <a rel=nofollow href=#>Dr. Margarita Lolis, MD</a>, a board-certified New Jersey-based dermatologist. “Organic bedding is made without the harsh chemicals and detergents that are used to manufacture regular bedding. If you’re someone with sensitive skin that gets irritated easily, it may be a beneficial switch,” explains Dr. Lolis.</p><p>Organic sheets come in almost every shape, size, color, and even fabric—we found options in crisp cotton for hot sleepers, cozy flannel for winter nights, and even a crib-sized version that should nab a spot on every baby registry.</p><p>Read on for everything you need to know about switching to organic sheets, including our picks for the best of the best.</p><h2 id=what-to-consider-when-buying-organic-sheets>What to consider when buying organic sheets</h2><h3>Look for keywords</h3><p>‘Organic,’ as a word, means different things to different companies. We suggest looking for keywords like OKEO-TEX and GOTS-certified, since those programs require manufacturers to meet specific standards. Here’s more about what each term means:</p><p>When fabric is GOTS-certified, it means it was grown without the use of synthetic pesticides or GMOs. Additionally, GOTS (it’s short for Global Organic Textile Standard) ensures that materials are grown using sustainable farming practices. It also mandates fair labor conditions, ensuring that workers involved in cotton production are treated ethically.</p><p>OKEO-TEX certification was established in the early 1990s by the International Association for Research and Testing in the Field of Textile and Leather Ecology. The process involves rigorous testing and evaluation of textiles at every stage of production, from raw materials to the finished product, like sheets or pillows. OKEO-TEX certification verifies that the textiles meet strict environmental and health criteria, including limits on certain chemicals, dyes, and finishes.</p><h3>Consider the big picture</h3><p>How the raw materials are grown, treated, and harvested, how much water the weaving process uses, and even shipping methods all contribute to a product’s overall eco-friendliness. When researching companies, take a moment to see if they provide information on their production process, and any steps they’re taking to consider the environmental impact of making and shipping their products.</p><h2 id=our-picks-for-the-best-organic-sheets>Our picks for the best organic sheets</h2><h3>Best value organic sheet set: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Quince Luxury Organic Sateen Sheet Set</a></h3><p>If you’re just beginning to consider replacing some of your household basics with organic versions, these Quince sheets are a great place to start: The sateen fabric stays cool throughout the night (great for hot sleepers!), they come in a variety of neutral shades, and the brand’s commitment to organics is bona-fide. (If you prefer percale, Quince’s set won a spot on our list of the <a rel=alternate href=#>best percale sheets</a>.) Made according to OEKO-TEX® standards, they’re even produced using green energy, in the form of power generated by windmills.</p><p>At around $100 for a set, they won’t break the bank, and the sateen weave has a luxe look. We also love that the top and bottom sheets come with handy labels, sure to make bed-making a breeze.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Materials: 100% organic cotton</li><li>Weave: 300 Thread Count</li><li>Sizes Available: Twin, Full, Queen, King, California King</li><li>Care: Machine washable</li><li>Price: $99.90 for a Queen set</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Set comes with or without a top sheet</li><li>Affordable</li><li>365-day return policy</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Might be too shiny for some shoppers</li></ul><p><span class=best-for>Best value organic sheet set</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Quince Luxury Organic Sateen Sheet Set</h3></p><h3>Best organic cotton sheets: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Garnet Hill Siesta Patterned Organic-Cotton Percale Sheets</a></h3><p>Garnet Hill has been doing organic cotton products for decades, so it’s no surprise their sheets are some of the best around. The cotton the brand uses is farmed without pesticides, GMOs, or chemical defoliants, and they come in a wide variety of colors and patterns. The floral prints, available in a cheery apple-green and a perfectly-faded lilac, have a vintage vibe, while the striped versions, in blue, green, and gold, have a beach house feel.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Materials: 100% organic cotton</li><li>Weave: 200 thread count</li><li>Sizes Available: Twin, Full, Queen, King/California King</li><li>Care: Machine washable</li><li>Price on publish: $27.00-$51.00</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Sold mix-and-match style, making it easy to get what you want</li><li>Unique patterns are bold without being overwhelming</li><li>Brand has 30+ year history</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Patterns might be too busy for neutral-lovers</li><li>Lower thread count</li></ul><p><span class=best-for>Best organic cotton sheets</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Garnet Hill Siesta Patterned Organic-Cotton Percale Sheets</h3></p><h3>Best affordable organic sheets: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Shabby Chic Organic Cotton Bedding Set</a></h3><p>A complete set of organic sheets (fitted sheet, flat sheet, and two pillowcases) for $50?

Today, Shabby Chic focuses on marrying the brand’s signature vibe with sustainability and affordability.</p><p>This set of organic sheets is made from GOTS-certified cotton, and comes in a selection of delicate hues, like blush pink and pale lavender.

The brand is transparent about their processes and materials, too. From using marigolds as a natural pest repellent and potato starch as an alternative to acrylic plastics, they’re taking ‘organic’ to the next level.</p><p>Made for all-season use, the color selection is heavy on natural shades, like sage green and light sand, and the brand also sells matching duvet covers, extra pillowcases, and waffle-knit blankets (all in organic cotton, of course!).</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Materials: 100% organic cotton</li><li>Weave: 300 thread count</li><li>Sizes Available: Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King, Split King</li><li>Care: Machine wash (some shrinkage is normal!)</li><li>Price: $279 for a Queen set</li></ul><p>What we like:</p><ul><li>Discount codes frequently available</li><li>Widest variety of sizes on our list</li></ul><p>What we don’t like:</p><ul><li>Higher price point</li><li>Return window is only 30 days</li></ul><p><span class=best-for>Best luxury organic sheets</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Boll & Branch Signature Hemmed Sheet Set</h3></p><h3>The best organic bamboo sheets: <a rel=nofollow href=#>SIJO DOZ Organic Bamboo Sheet Set</a></h3><p>Bamboo sheets are a hot sleeper’s dream: buttery-soft in texture, the fabric is both cooling and moisture-wicking, helping avoid midnight trips to the thermostat or fights over bedroom temperature. These are OEKO-TEX certified, and have the signature softness associated with bamboo—it’s like your favorite worn-in t-shirt, turned into a set of sheets.</p><p>Bamboo products tend to be more affordable than their cotton, wool, and linen counterparts, making these a great alternative to pricier picks. If you love the softness of jersey t-shirt-style sheets (or just the feel of your favorite worn-in t-shirt), these are one of the <a rel=alternate href=#>best bamboo sheets</a> for you.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Materials: 100% organic bamboo viscose</li><li>Weave: N/A</li><li>Sizes Available: Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King</li><li>Care: Machine washable</li><li>Price: $55 for a Queen set</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Affordable price point</li><li>One of the softest fabrics on the market</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Delicate—keep them away from zippers, Velcro, or coarser fabrics</li><li>People who go for a crisp texture might find these too soft</li></ul><p><span class=best-for>The best organic bamboo sheets</span></p><p><h3 class=title>SIJO DOZ Organic Bamboo Sheet Set</h3></p><h3>The best organic flannel sheets: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Coyuchi Cloud Brushed Organic Flannel Sheet Set</a></h3><p>Whether you’re dealing with a drafty bedroom or simply want to maximize the cozy factor of your space, flannel sheets are a must-have come fall. These organic flannel sheets by Coyuchi—they do everything from bedding to loungewear—will keep you toasty all night long, especially if you opt for the matching duvet cover.</p><p>Made from cotton grown in Turkey and woven in Portugal, they use the brand’s proprietary weaving and brushing process, and are meant to get softer the longer you have them.

Parachute’s organic linen sheets, which made our list of the <a rel=alternate href=#>best linen bed sheets</a>, are a stand out choice. They come in colors like rich terra cotta and soft clay pink, and are made in Portugal from flax grown in Europe using organic processes. The brand’s commitment to being eco-friendly even extends to their shipping, which is carbon neutral (and free!). If you’re a hot sleeper, you may want to take a look at Parachute’s percale set, which made our list of the <a rel=alternate href=#>best cooling sheets</a>.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Materials: 100% flax</li><li>Weave: N/A</li><li>Sizes Available: Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King</li><li>Care: Machine washable</li><li>Price: $209 for a Queen fitted sheet and two pillowcases; price goes up to $329 with the addition of a top sheet</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Free, carbon-neutral shipping</li><li>Transparent production process</li><li>Mix of neutral and bold colors</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Top sheets are not included</li><li>Seasonal colors go out of stock quickly</li></ul><p><span class=best-for>Best organic linen sheets</span></p><p><h3 class=title>King Linen Sheet Set in Bone | Parachute</h3></p><h3>Best deep-pocket organic sheets: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Avocado Deep Pocket Organic Sheets</a></h3><p>If you’ve ever struggled to put a fitted sheet on a too-high mattress, you know it can feel impossible. It’s not just you, though—some mattresses genuinely are too thick for standard sheets, which is why we love that Avocado makes these organic cotton sheets in a special deep-pocket version. Designed to fit mattresses up to 22 inches in thickness, they pair nicely with the brand’s own organic mattress but will work on a standard mattress, too, making them a versatile pick.</p><p>Woven from GOTS-certified organic Indian cotton, these will stay in place without bunching on even the plushest pillowtop beds. Shopping tip: If you’re looking to refresh your bedroom, Avocado is quite possibly a one-stop-shop, especially if you are looking for certified organic mattresses and bedding. Their products made our list of the <a rel=alternate href=#>best pillows</a>, <a rel=alternate href=#>best latex mattress toppers</a>, <a rel=alternate href=#>best mattress-in-a-box</a>, and <a rel=alternate href=#>best bed sheets</a>.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Materials: 100% organic cotton</li><li>Weave: 600 thread count</li><li>Sizes Available: Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King, Split King</li><li>Care: Machine washable</li><li>Price: $259 for a Queen set</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Fits even the thickest mattresses</li><li>Silkier than other cotton options</li><li>Comes with a 100 trial period and a full year’s warranty</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Only two colors available</li><li>Silky texture might be uncomfortable for hot sleepers</li></ul><h3>Best organic crib sheets: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Burt’s Bees Organic Cotton BEESNUG Fitted Crib Sheet</a></h3><p>These sheets, in Burt’s Bees woven cotton (it’s GOTS-certified), are warmer than standard woven sheets, meant to have the feeling of a worn-in flannel shirt or a cozy sweatshirt. An extra fabric overlap on the bottom edges helps keep them securely on the mattress, and they’re both combed and ringspun for durability—you can throw these in the washing machine as often as you like.</p><p>When it comes to patterns, you’ve got options ranging from fairy-tale bears to colorful flowers, but we especially love the whimsical giraffes and, of course, the happy honeybees.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Materials: 100% organic cotton</li><li>Weave: N/A</li><li>Sizes Available: Fits standard crib and toddler-size mattresses</li><li>Care: Machine washable</li><li>Price: $20.95</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Affordable, especially on sale</li><li>Cute patterns fit a wide array of nursery-decor styles</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Some reviewers report shrinkage after washing</li></ul><p><span class=best-for>Best organic crib sheets</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Burt’s Bees Organic Cotton BEESNUG Fitted Crib Sheet</h3></p><h2 id=how-did-we-select-the-best-organic-sheets>How did we select the best organic sheets?</h2><p>By looking at a variety of companies and retailers, we honed in on the sheets that appealed most, based on factors like price point, thread count, and customer reviews. We also looked for organic sheets in a variety of different fabrics, choosing the best of the best in linen, flannel, bamboo, and cotton.</p><h2 id=how-to-make-sure-your-sheets-are-organic>How to make sure your sheets are organic</h2><p>The easiest way to ensure that the sheets you bought are actually organic, is to look for the GOTS and OEKO-TEK certifications.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>What are organic sheets?</h3><p>Organic sheets are bedsheets that, to start, are made using organic materials—organic refers to both the raw product (like cotton, linen, or bamboo) and the manufacturing process (how much waste the factory produces, ethical labor standards, and carbon-neutral transport and shipping). Organic bedsheets are produced using fabric that hasn’t been treated with harsh chemicals or dyes at any step of the production journey.</p><h3>Are organic bed sheets worth it?</h3><p>Organic sheets are available at a variety of price points, making them a solid choice for consumers who want to be more eco-friendly around the house! Whatever your fabric preference, there’s probably an organic version, and many of the sheets we highlighted on this list come from brands that offer frequent sales or discount codes.</p><h3>How do you wash organic sheets?</h3><p>Every set of sheets we picked is machine washable, with standard guidance to wash in cold water and either line-dry or tumble-dry on the lowest possible setting. You don’t have to use organic detergents and fabric softeners on your organic sheets, but it doesn’t hurt. The question of <a rel=alternate href=#>how often you should wash your sheets</a> is hotly debated, but in general, you should plan to wash them once a week (or every other week, at the very least).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1ln6e0orrInGSsoJWawbR7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tessa-ia-nailea-norvind-hyperballad-1235794785.html><span>←</span><span>After Lucias Tessa Ia to Star in Hyperballad, A Potential Standout at Ventana S</span></a>
