Scammers are getting more sophisticated in&nbsp;their attempts to&nbsp;get closer to&nbsp;you and use their skills to&nbsp;scam you. They use strange things like envelopes in&nbsp;the <a href=# title=car data-link=tag>car</a> and other weird stuff on&nbsp;the hood to&nbsp;target everyone, regardless of&nbsp;their age and background. Let’s see how you can recognize the <a href=# title="red flags" data-link=tag>red flags</a> and know what to&nbsp;do.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/d43/b60/c524675105a85aba8fcc970025.jpeg><p>It’s late evening. You park your car in&nbsp;the supermarket lot, lock&nbsp;it, and go&nbsp;shopping. When you return, you see someone has wrapped a&nbsp;shirt around one of&nbsp;your windshield wipers. Don’t pause to&nbsp;get the piece of&nbsp;clothing off your windshield if&nbsp;this really happens to&nbsp;you. Instead, get into your car as&nbsp;quickly as&nbsp;possible and drive away. Find a&nbsp;well-lit spot, preferably with other people around, and only then stop and toss the shirt out.</p><p>It’s a&nbsp;relatively new trick criminal use to&nbsp;distract lonely drivers’ attention: the shirt or&nbsp;other sizable piece of&nbsp;cloth makes you stop and pull it&nbsp;off. While you’re doing this, they can sneak up&nbsp;on&nbsp;you, and who knows what happens then? If&nbsp;you have shopping bags on&nbsp;you, it’s best not to&nbsp;open your trunk either, as&nbsp;it&nbsp;also makes you vulnerable to&nbsp;prowlers and prevents you from acting fast. Toss the bags into the car and sort them out later when you’re safe.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/dc4/5ff/23d93d5d5db6b28b161f37a043.jpeg><p>What might be&nbsp;sending even more shivers down your spine is&nbsp;finding an&nbsp;envelope inside your car when you return to&nbsp;it. You definitely locked&nbsp;it, so&nbsp;someone was able to&nbsp;break&nbsp;in. First of&nbsp;all, remember basic security and drive off immediately. Then, best toss the envelope without opening it&nbsp;— there might be&nbsp;something nasty inside for all you know.</p><p>But suppose your curiosity took the upper hand, and you still opened&nbsp;it. In&nbsp;that case, you might find a&nbsp;message inside that says something like, “Dear Sir/Madam, we’ve tested your car’s security and found it&nbsp;unsatisfactory. As&nbsp;you can see, your car can easily be&nbsp;broken into. We&nbsp;expect you to&nbsp;pay&nbsp;us for this test, and in&nbsp;return, we’ll make sure to&nbsp;send someone to&nbsp;help you install a&nbsp;better security system.”</p><p>Well, it’s good they’ve taken nothing, so&nbsp;toss the envelope away and disregard the message. If&nbsp;you pay scammers, they’re likely to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;again or&nbsp;even try something worse. The best you can do&nbsp;is&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;trusted car service and check your security system on&nbsp;your own, or&nbsp;even replace the one you have if&nbsp;you’re not sure of&nbsp;its capabilities anymore.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/bb9/22f/1631ea5d46abc36ed1660d1df4.jpeg><p>A&nbsp;water bottle on&nbsp;your car’s hood is&nbsp;a&nbsp;sign you’re in&nbsp;grave danger. Like a&nbsp;clothing item on&nbsp;your windshield wipers, it’s meant to&nbsp;distract you and make you get out of&nbsp;the car, but this case is&nbsp;even worse. Even if&nbsp;you don’t go&nbsp;out to&nbsp;remove the bottle or&nbsp;any other relatively large and distracting object and drive home immediately, you might be&nbsp;up&nbsp;for something terrible.</p><p>The people who put the bottle on&nbsp;your car’s hood might’ve installed a&nbsp;GPS tracker on&nbsp;your car, so&nbsp;driving home puts you at&nbsp;risk of&nbsp;them following you there. You should either find a&nbsp;safe spot with many people around and check your car for the tracker or&nbsp;go&nbsp;straight to&nbsp;the nearest police station and ask them to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;for you.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/9a3/aef/a536eb5eb0ab443b48eb43511b.jpeg><p>When a&nbsp;stranger asks you to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;picture of&nbsp;them and gives you a&nbsp;phone, don’t be&nbsp;too quick to&nbsp;take&nbsp;it. Look at&nbsp;them first. If&nbsp;they look suspicious or&nbsp;unfriendly, it’s better to&nbsp;refuse the request nicely. This might be&nbsp;a&nbsp;fraud.</p><p>They give you the phone, you turn on&nbsp;the camera and see that it’s broken&nbsp;— the image in&nbsp;the photo is&nbsp;damaged. You give the stranger their phone back, and they accuse you of&nbsp;breaking the phone. They demand <a href=# title=money data-link=tag>money</a> and start making a&nbsp;scene.</p><p>In&nbsp;such a&nbsp;situation, it’s better not to&nbsp;panic and not to&nbsp;be&nbsp;provoked. Calmly leave. Make it&nbsp;clear that you won’t fall for this. And if&nbsp;they behave too aggressively, then call the police.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/8bf/afa/d2b5b5514d99aa20db635e70ce.jpeg><p>Thieves can put an&nbsp;advertising flyer, a&nbsp;newspaper, or&nbsp;a&nbsp;sticker on&nbsp;your house or&nbsp;apartment door. You can find a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;paper or&nbsp;a&nbsp;thin strip from a&nbsp;plastic bottle in&nbsp;the doorway. If&nbsp;you don’t remove one of&nbsp;these items for a&nbsp;long time, then the thieves understand that you’re not at&nbsp;home. This way, thieves mark buildings and apartments that are easy to&nbsp;get into.</p><p>After all, getting into an&nbsp;empty apartment is&nbsp;much safer. So, as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;you see a&nbsp;foreign object, immediately get rid of&nbsp;it. If&nbsp;a&nbsp;flyer or&nbsp;bookmark hangs on&nbsp;the door for one or&nbsp;two days, it&nbsp;tells the thief that no&nbsp;one’s home. Of&nbsp;course, these can be&nbsp;real advertising stickers, but you still don’t need them.</p><p>In&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;flyers, there may be&nbsp;strange labels on&nbsp;the house or&nbsp;apartment door&nbsp;— numbers, crosses, or&nbsp;other symbols. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;how burglars mark houses they’re about to&nbsp;break into. If&nbsp;you see such a&nbsp;sign, it’s better to&nbsp;call the police.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/b6b/78f/0e4b8f57f6803e8429e7b2f952.jpeg><p>You’re driving home from work and suddenly notice you’re almost out of&nbsp;<a href=# title=gas data-link=tag>gas</a>. That’s weird because you recently filled a&nbsp;full tank. You go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the gas station and to&nbsp;the car repair center to&nbsp;check if&nbsp;there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;gas leak in&nbsp;the vehicle.</p><p>Meanwhile, robbers can take things out of&nbsp;your house. They deliberately drained the fuel from your car so&nbsp;that you’d go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the gas station. They detain you and buy time to&nbsp;clean out your home. If&nbsp;you’re sure that you refueled recently and the gas was drained from you, you should call your neighbors and ask them to&nbsp;monitor your house or&nbsp;apartment.</p><p>Burglars might stage some accident to&nbsp;lure you out of&nbsp;your house. Please don’t fall for&nbsp;it! If&nbsp;there is&nbsp;actually some accident, it’s always better to&nbsp;call 911. Also, beware of&nbsp;weird calls when someone calls you and keeps silent. If&nbsp;they started bothering you quite often, it&nbsp;could be&nbsp;a&nbsp;sign that your house is&nbsp;now a&nbsp;burglar’s target, and they want to&nbsp;check if&nbsp;you’re home.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/810/bec/74869f5d7480a7b5fa63046aa8.jpeg><p>Always make sure that the taxi meter is&nbsp;working when you get into a&nbsp;cab. If&nbsp;you take a&nbsp;seat and the driver tells you the meter is&nbsp;broken, you better get out at&nbsp;once and call another car. You could get charged much more than the regular fee without the meter, especially if&nbsp;you’re not a&nbsp;local.</p><p>Your car’s broken down in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;an&nbsp;interstate, so&nbsp;you call a&nbsp;towing service. But in&nbsp;less than five minutes, a&nbsp;tow truck stops&nbsp;by, and the driver offers you help. It’s best to&nbsp;reject the offer politely&nbsp;— granted, you’ll have to&nbsp;wait longer, but at&nbsp;least you won’t be&nbsp;overcharged.</p><p>There are towing companies that take advantage of&nbsp;unfortunate drivers stranded in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;nowhere. This kind stranger might take your car prisoner until you pay double the regular charge. If&nbsp;you’re not sure the tow truck that’s arrived at&nbsp;your help is&nbsp;the one you called for, call the service again and ask for the number on&nbsp;the license plate.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/fad/235/53dcfe590e981bc37ee3740a41.jpeg><p>When you choose a&nbsp;parking spot, it’s best to&nbsp;avoid those next to&nbsp;larger vehicles than yours. They block your line of&nbsp;sight, and you can quickly become the target for someone with bad intentions hiding behind the van or&nbsp;truck next to&nbsp;your car.</p><p>When someone calls you and says they’re representing your bank, be&nbsp;aware that bank employees will never ask you for your account information, including your PIN or&nbsp;a&nbsp;one-time code sent to&nbsp;your phone. If&nbsp;someone asks you that, best hang up&nbsp;and call the bank on&nbsp;your own&nbsp;— just use the number on&nbsp;its website.</p><p>Paying with your bank card or&nbsp;through an&nbsp;e-wallet via a&nbsp;trusted service is&nbsp;the only safe way to&nbsp;pay online. If&nbsp;a&nbsp;company asks you specifically to&nbsp;pay in&nbsp;an&nbsp;unusual way, such as&nbsp;a&nbsp;gift card, a&nbsp;voucher, or&nbsp;a&nbsp;transfer to&nbsp;another bank card through your online banking app, mark it&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;huge red flag for scammers. A&nbsp;real company wouldn’t make you do&nbsp;that, and they’ll also provide you with an&nbsp;electronic check afterward.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLanediorGaemaOxbq2MsJitnaJir7DA06WcZqeeYsawwdFmmpqqXZy8bsDOZphmqJ%2BhtqSxjKyrmqyZpLtuhJBsbXJqXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./birthdays.html><span>←</span><span>Famous Birthdays on June 27</span></a>
