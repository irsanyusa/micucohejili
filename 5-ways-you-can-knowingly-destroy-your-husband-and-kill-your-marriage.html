(Yup—he’s still here.) Anyway—and to all the wives out there, I hope this is helpful!—here are a couple things I’m trying out to see if we can really get the ball rolling around here, if you know what I mean. (Caveat: Every woman is different. This is just what’s working for me. :) )</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Quitting my job</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A week ago, I was head of sales and marketing for a small technology company. But I quit so I could watch Law and Order: SVU all day. My husband came home and saw me on the couch and asked me if that was really how I was going to spend all my time. So I showed him a needlepoint I’d just done of Mariska Hargitay interrogating a suspect. “Really? That’s it?” he demanded, and I showed him a totally different one, of Mariska Hargitay getting out of a taxi, and he was not amused.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Talking a lot without thinking about what I’m saying</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I used to try to be interesting, funny, and insightful when I talked to my husband. Now I tell really long stories and refer to everyone I mention as “my best friend.” I narrate my dreams, always relying heavily on the phrase: “Umm, and then, there was like, I don’t know, like, this weird thing, I can’t really describe it.” Naturally, I also narrate entire plots of Law and Order: SVU, and I have added Christopher Meloni needlepoints to my repertoire—even though I obviously have no intention of keeping those, or even giving them as gifts—so I can use them to help act stuff out. (Needlepoints make great handpuppets if you’ve got some rubber bands lying around!)</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Wearing flannel nightgowns everywhere</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When I was a little girl, my mother, who was always full of the wisest, kindest advice, sat me down, took my tiny hands in her big ones and said, “There’s nothing a man hates more than a flannel nightgown.” Then she winked and said, “Seriously, they really hate them.” When I greeted my husband at the door in it, he went ashen. And it was at that moment I realized how much my mom really loved me.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Doing stuff to look older faster</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I sunbathe in an aluminum foil lined pen while working myself into states of great stress, consuming foods with a high content of free radicals, and drinking Bacardi 151 mixed with Coke Zero. But like I said, you have to find what works for you.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Just kind of being a big bitch a lot of the time</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I do a lot of bitchy stuff but here’s just one example. The other day my husband said “Maybe for the holidays we can have Christmas with your parents and New Years with mine” and I said “Ugh.” Then he said “What’s for dinner, babe?” and I said “Circus peanuts” and he said “Are you serious?” I thought about how Katelyn Carmen said we should always be open with our husbands about how we really feel. So I dumped a bag of circus peanuts in his lap and I said “Do I seem serious?”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZsbmNnhXiAjm5ksJmpqHq6u9RmmpqmXaC7sMPIp56lsV2ZsrTA0aiwZrGfqr9utNSsmZqmlGKur7CMpKClpF2uvLa%2BjKaYq6qZlrSmew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./women-share-10-tips-on-how-to-stay-safe-while-out-and-about-801585.html><span>←</span><span>Women Share 10 Tips on How to Stay Safe While Out and About</span></a>
