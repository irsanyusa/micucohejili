Slow loris</h3></p><p>The slow loris is a cute bijoux and big-eyed animal that live in the rainforests of South and Southeast Asia. At first glance, they look like this cute animals that are cuddly with gentle eyes. While this is true, the slow loris are actually toxic, fractious and the world’s only venomous primate.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-3df471bd-ffb7-4e6f-9967-e30f1e4e09c8 data-caption="Don't be decieved by those eyes [RoundGlass Sustain]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/1h8ktkqTURBXy9mYmUyYzBlMDJmNjVmNjFlMTUzMjk4NWU1NjJjNmU2YS5qcGVnkZUCzQKAzQHgwsM></span><p>Anytime the slow loris feel attacked, they immediately mix their toxins into their saliva and fur to harm perceived predators. Bites from these little creatures can cause extreme illness. Their venom can make the flesh rot and lead to immediate death in many cases.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-9>2. Polar bears</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Polar bears over time have been painted as cute and cuddly especially with their cute fur. But these animals can actually stalk humans and eat them.

Panda</h3></p><p>Pandas can be seen as one of the cutest animals on earth. These animals are herbivores and hence do not need to eat human flesh. But that has not stopped them from attacking humans. Pandas can inflict severe and deadly puncture wounds on humans especially when they are provoked.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-14>4. Mute swans</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Mute swans are also cute animals that are actually dangerous. They are quite territorial when it comes to their nests.
