This piercing involves inserting a piece of jewellery through the frenulum, a tissue section connecting the upper lip's upper part to the gums. It is the best choice for those who desire a piercing that they <a href=#>can</a> hide because it is usually hidden unless you smile.</p><h2 id=1594287-what-is-smiley-piercing class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>What is smiley piercing?</h2><p class=align-left>Smiley piercing, also known as the frenulum piercing, is an oral piercing that goes through the frenulum, the small, thin piece of skin connecting your upper lip to your upper gum. As the name suggests, it will mostly be seen when you smile.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/5dfe9f47630eed78.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nose piercing 101: what you need to know before you get one</span></p></a><p class=align-left>This type of piercing is perfect for those who want a more low-key oral piercing than other lip and mouth piercing variations. However, unknown to many, the procedure does not work for everyone. The frenulum is thin, posing a greater risk of being torn or rejected. Therefore, it is important to know everything before opting for this process.</p><h3 id=1594287-smiley-piercing-pain-level class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Smiley piercing pain level</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/5dfe9f47630eed78.png><p class=align-left>Does a smiley piercing hurt? There is generally minimal pain during a smiley piercing. This is because the frenulum tissue is rich in nerves. Since it is very thin, the procedure is very fast, and the sharp pain is short, lasting only a few seconds. However, pain tolerance and thresholds may vary from person to person.</p><h3 id=1594287-smiley-piercing-healing-time class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Smiley piercing healing time</h3><p class=align-left>The healing process for a smiley piercing can vary from person to person, but if there are no complications like infection, it <a id="https://floria.it/the-smiley-piercing/?lang=en" href=# rel="nofollow noopener">normally heals</a> within 4 to 12 weeks.
