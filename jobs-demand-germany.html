<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Which jobs are in demand in Germany?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>With a high standard of living, great public transport and highly <a href=#>livable cities</a>, many people consider moving to Germany to seek employment. What’s more, Germany’s recent shortage of skilled workers means that there is plenty of opportunity for trained and educated professionals throughout Germany. Here you find a list of just some of the best and most highly sought-after fields of work. For many of these positions, you won’t necessarily have to <a href=#>speak German</a>, but a good knowledge of the <a href=#>language</a> will greatly enhance your chances of finding your dream job in Germany!</p><li><a href=#>Computer science, IT and software development</a></li><li><a href=#>Electronics engineering</a></li><li><a href=#>Mechanical engineering</a></li><li><a href=#>Account management and business analytics</a></li><li><a href=#>Nursing and healthcare</a></li><li><a href=#>Civil engineering and architecture</a></li><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=1.-Computer-science,-IT-and-software-development>1. Computer science, IT and software development</h2><p>Unsurprisingly, in a large developed economy like Germany’s, there is considerable demand for tech gurus. In cities like <a href=#>Berlin</a>, where tech <a href=#>startups</a> provide many of the job opportunities, professionals with computer science, IT and software development skills are in high demand for developing the technologies behind new and innovative business practices. So if you have the skills these positions require you’ll have no trouble finding work in some of the most demanded jobs in Germany.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=2.-Electronics-engineering>2. Electronics engineering</h2><p>Expertise in the field of electronics engineering will give you access to some of the best-paid jobs you will find in Germany. The highly developed German economy creates a huge demand for the development of electronic components, devices and systems. So if you are a qualified electronics engineer, you probably won’t have much trouble finding a well-paying job with excellent perks anywhere in Germany.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=3.-Mechanical-engineering>3. Mechanical engineering</h2><p>Mechanical engineers will find wide-ranging career options in almost any sector, with considerable demand in the areas of automation, renewable energy, manufacturing or aerospace. This is because the design, analysis and maintenance of mechanical systems is crucially important for the German economy. And this is good news for mechanical engineers, because German companies are always on the lookout for talented individuals with expertise in this field. What’s more, mechanical engineers can likely expect to receive a strong <a href=#>annual salary</a> and excellent working conditions in Germany.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=4.-Account-management-and-business-analytics>4. Account management and business analytics</h2><p>Any major business will be on the lookout for account managers and experts in business data analytics to aid problem-solving and decision-making in the running of the company, so it’s no surprise that these jobs are trending in Germany. These business professionals will perform tasks such as increasing sales of a product or service, seeking out upselling opportunities and maximizing employee retention for a better, smooth-running business. Experienced professionals to fill these jobs are in the greatest demand in the major business and finance centers of Germany such as <a href=#>Frankfurt</a>, <a href=#>Munich</a> and <a href=#>Hamburg</a>, where business data is crucial to the local economy.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=5.-Nursing-and-healthcare>5. Nursing and healthcare</h2><p>Wherever you go in the world, there is always demand for healthcare professionals – and Germany is no exception. Indeed, Germany has a real shortage of highly trained medical professionals, particularly nurses, to care for its citizens. Beware though, you will need to fulfill the stringent demands of the German Ministry for Health. A high level of proficiency in German is required in order to be able to carry out your role in a safe and effective manner. Your <a href=#>qualifications</a> from other countries are not always transferable to the German context, so extra training may be required.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=6.-Civil-engineering-and-architecture>6. Civil engineering and architecture</h2><p>Low interest rates in recent years have led to increased demand for housing and consequently for the planning and technical skills of trained civil engineers and architects.<strong> </strong>Germany’s dynamic and flourishing construction industry<strong> </strong>currently employs approximately 2 million people of whom civil engineers and architects are amongst the best-paid and highly regarded. The skill set required to carry out individual building projects or even to shape entire districts through urban planning and development in architecture are in serious demand. While salaries vary considerably depending on your industry, location and whether you are working <a href=#>freelance</a>, professionals in this field can expect to be well paid for their expertise.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Prosperous professionals</h2><p>Whether you are based in Germany and seeking new professional opportunities or considering moving here to find work, there are many exciting opportunities to be found throughout the country. If you want to make your living in Germany there are plenty of paths to choose from, not only in tech development and engineering, but also in public service positions and many other fields beyond those listed here.
