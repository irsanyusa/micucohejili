There are pending appeals against recognition orders issued in both the US and UK.</p><p>Ogun State also engaged Zhongshan in settlement discussions on reasonable terms.</p><p>The last meeting, held in September 2023 in London, was attended by several officials of Ogun, including <strong>Governor Dapo Abiodun</strong> and <strong>Prince Lateef Fagbemi</strong>, Attorney General/Minister of Justice.</p><p>Zhongshan’s initial reasonable readiness to consider Ogun State’s offer was surprisingly reversed by the second day when it insisted on the government paying the full arbitration debt.</p><p>This led to a breakdown of the mediation, with parties agreeing to meet again in the first quarter of this year.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>But Onanuga said since then, Zhongshan has been evasive.</p><p>“Instead, it embarked on a series of enforcement proceedings, which the legal team appointed by the Federal Government and Ogun successfully opposed.</p><p>“In cases similar to the present one, where Zhongshan obtained an ex-parte order, Ogun State successfully set aside the orders.</p><p>“Ogun has not given up on a reasonable settlement option, with the most recent letter sent to Zhongshan last week.</p><p>“Zhongshan only responded after obtaining this latest illegal order,” said Onanuga.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0mijqJuRoXyxvsSsoJ2dnpjGbq7Lmqqtq12Ytaq6xKycZpufor2iuthmpq%2BdomK9rbvTZquoZaOpv6q8jKegoJ2inq5uu8VmoZ6so2R%2BpbnLr5px</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./operation-crocodile-smile-iii-5929-flood-victims-get-relief-items-spokesman.html><span>←</span><span>Operation Crocodile Smile III: 5,929 flood victims get relief items Spokesman</span></a>
