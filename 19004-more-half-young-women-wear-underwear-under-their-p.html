Close to seven in ten women (69%) say they “always” or “sometimes” wear pyjamas to bed, with approaching half of these (33%) normally wearing underwear (pants or knickers) under their PJs.</p><p>Age plays a key factor, with younger women far more likely to wear both pyjamas and underwear than their older counterparts. Around half (49%) of 18-24 year old women wear underwear beneath their pyjamas to bed, compared to a fifth (19%) of women aged 65+.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/PJs20in20bed-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>By contrast, men are far less likely to wear pyjamas in the first place, let alone wear both pyjamas and underwear. Only 41% of men say they “always” or “sometimes” wear pyjamas to bed, and of these only a quarter (10%) wear underwear underneath them.</p><h4><strong>Pyjamas should stay indoors</strong></h4><p>In other <a href=#>recent pyjama-related YouGov research</a>, we discovered that that one in three young Brits (32% of 18-24 year-olds) believe that it is acceptable to go out in public wearing pyjamas. Their elder peers are far less impressed, with just 8% of 65+ year olds saying the same.</p><p><span class="live-survey-results hidden">LIVE SURVEY RESULTS</span>Photo: Getty</p><p><a href=#><strong>See the full results here</strong></a></p><p><a href=#>Find out more about YouGov Omnibus research</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkvbC4yK2gnKtflr%2B1tcKlnKxnYW59cYCMpqarnV2drq2yjLKmrqaXYsSwucSnZLCdkad6trrDnqmwnZGnera6w56pZqyYmrazec8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./if-you-find-a-water-bottle-on-your-car-go-to-a-police-station-813692.html><span>←</span><span>If You Find a Water Bottle on Your Car, Go to a Police Station</span></a>
