First of all, nourishing your hair with the natural oils or the special hydrating balms before you get to style your hair is important. You can let the hair dry overnight.

In addition, you can choose to sleep with a satin scarf covering your head.</p><h2>How to style natural hair? Best hairstyles for short-haired ladies</h2><h3>1. Cornrow protection for short hair</h3><p class=align-left>You can opt for a protective braided hairstyle for your short hair. Professionally done braids will protect your hair from the outer factors for the whole day long, and the braided patterns will make your hair look unique. With this style, you will always look confident and beautiful.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/aa6dc6fa8a58fc07.jpg><h3>2. Classic braids</h3><p class=align-left>The best benefit of braids is that they are long-lasting – they can basically be practical for weeks, with very little effort from you to maintain them. Braided hairstyles for shorter hair are no less great than the longer ones – they give you this special charm, and they are light and comfortable to wear. Try the bob-length braids, add the smile to your face, and your look will be perfect.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a5d742ac62f785c2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Make a statement with these 15 lovely short natural hairstyles</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt35o7l341pot.jpg><h3>3. Sealed hair with twist</h3><p class=align-left>In order to create this hairstyle, you can smooth out your natural hairstyle, and then twist it towards the back of the neck. Then, secure it with a low bun. Your look is completed! This is the hairstyle for those who are always young and vibrant.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a5d742ac62f785c2.jpg><h3>4. Braided crown with low bun</h3><p class=align-left>This interesting hairdo will turn you into a real princess or queen, and of course, boost your confidence. In addition, the braid is one of the simplest ways to keep up a regular low bun. The hairstyle looks especially formal, so you can wear it to the events that are special to you.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt5iqqc154de1.jpg><h3>5. Natural flat twist hairstyle</h3><p class=align-left>Flat twists are one of the most common protective hairdos for women with short hair. They give the cornrow vibes, but they are much faster and easier to make. If you want your updo to last at least a few days, you should definitely turn to this styling.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/bb3da7613c513996.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 short and protective natural hairstyles for beautiful African women</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt5rh1hfmgkdc.jpg><h3>6. Pineapple updo</h3><p class=align-left>This updo will make you look daring and brave, which is incredibly important for you when you want to seem confident in other people’s eyes. To style your hair this way, you should just pile all of your hair to the front of your head. This method can also be used when you have made a twist-out and want to sleep without ruining the style.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt1jqk1tlcb9ro.jpg><h3>7. Protective twists</h3><p class=align-left>Every woman with natural hair knows that after washing your hair, you often have to see it shrink. As a result of this, the hair seems more cropped than it is. In case you want to add the texture and try something that will keep your hair in order, you can choose the protective twists or braids.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/bb3da7613c513996.jpg><h3>8. Flat twist updo</h3><p class=align-left>Many of the natural hairstyles like jumbo cornrows or box braids have a downfall of pulling on edges or weighing down your strands. This is the opposite of hair protection that you need. In order to achieve the needed protective effect, you can pick the flat twist updo. It has a similar effect but is much easier and lighter for your head to wear.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/3782c8e0ee100a96.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>See the top-13 trendy braids for your amazing short natural hair</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt4epga9a14ql.jpg><h3>9. Mixed textures</h3><p class=align-left>Mixing two different textures together would be a really unique idea. For instance, you can try front cornrows and back twists, which will easily add the visual appeal to the hairstyle. Even without using accessories, this hairdo will always be on point.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt113lsedj23s8.jpg><h3>10. Twisted chignon</h3><p class=align-left>This hairstyle will not be easy enough to make at home. However, if you hire a professional hair stylist to do it for you, you will surely get a long-lasting protective hairdo that also looks elegant. Besides, you can also classify it as sporty. In case you are not a fan of flat twists, they can be easily replaced with cornrows.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt1l2g6u8m46d8.jpg><h3>11. Simple natural hairstyle</h3><p class=align-left>Simplicity is the key to the perfect hairstyle, so you can try the Dutch roll on your natural hair. It can be really good for these days when the twist out style does not turn out the way you want it to. The cute natural updo will always look neat and pretty.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/dba51fd5ac74fbab.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Thee top 15 short curly hairstyles will make you perfect</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/3782c8e0ee100a96.jpg><h3>12. Twist with side bang</h3><p class=align-left>The soft curls in protective natural hairstyles can work perfectly unless you decide to use flat irons or curling. Instead of these, you may choose to use the flex rods. By the way, this hairstyle radiates elegance and would be good either for daily activities or for some special outings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt30gf2gggm75.jpg><h3>13. Side partial updo for natural hair</h3><p class=align-left>While the low bun is a classic and timeless look that could work out well for any occasion, sometimes you might wish to add more elegance to it. In this case, you might add a roll that frames the face. This look will be ideal for any kind of business meeting, presentation at work, or special event after working hours.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt2c2d01be0bvg.jpg><h3>14. Fauxhawk with twists and cornrows</h3><p class=align-left>Mohawks made of cornrows offer you so many unique options of the designs that you can create, instead of simply shaving your head. These styles are more than just beauty and uniqueness – they also help your hair to grow longer and become healthier.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt3bc00m5e1sa.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 20 trendy natural hairstyles for short hair</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt4f4ea0tbm09.jpg><h3>15. Multi-sized bun</h3><p class=align-left>You may say that the buns are not original anymore, but look at this one, made of cornrows! If you combine the thick braids with the thin ones, you will be amazed with the result. For achieving this look, you can ask your hairdresser to braid up your hair into a ponytail, so you can later make a bun or any other lovely hairstyle out of it.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Braid hairstyles for long hair</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/dba51fd5ac74fbab.jpg><h3>16. Upswept flat twists updo</h3><p class=align-left>This hair option is both elegant and practical, which means it will not bother you when you are busy working on something, and it will as well be perfect for casual outings, gym visit, and morning jog. This is a whole new outlook on the original flat twist updo. It will keep your hair growing, and make your tresses stay out of the neck when it is warm outside.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt1nn3oo5kotu8.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The trendiest wool hairstyles for you in 2018</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt1p1vbmoqpmoo.jpg><h3>17. Asymmetrical braided updo</h3><p class=align-left>While individual braids are good as a protective style, there is one issue with them – they can get bulky, and their weight will pull on the hair edges, eventually causing hair breakage. So, maybe instead of box braids, you can choose the asymmetrical cornrow updo style, which will end up as a side bun or ponytail.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkytppm8mtdr5ig.jpg><h3>18. Asymmetrical twist braid as a side bun</h3><p class=align-left>This is a really sophisticated hairstyle, which means that you can wear elegant earrings and attractive makeup together with it, and create a smart and casual look. Most importantly, this hair will not take too long to style.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt370jn7q4n7s.jpg><h3>19. Crown twist braid with chignon</h3><p class=align-left>Here is another elegant hairdo which could be worn to various working events, and under certain circumstances, to the formal events as well. It can work with short to medium hair. Combined with natural black hair and its original beauty, this hair will look great on everyone.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt32skuum5gqg.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 15 natural hairstyles that you can wear every day</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt3bc00m5e1sa.jpg><h3>20. Goddess braids</h3><p class=align-left>You might have thought these gorgeous braids work only with long hair, but we can assure you it will look just as great on the person who has a shorter hairstyle. This choice guarantees that you will end up with a lovely hairdo which will protect your hair and attract the attention of natural braid lovers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt7f9fhano2i4.jpg><h3>21. Short natural twist updo</h3><p class=align-left>Having short hair does not indicate that you barely have any options – in fact, it is the opposite. The larger twists will give you a chance to have a cool textured updo, even in case your hair is too short for a bun or ponytail. By the way, highlighting or ombre style will definitely add some dimension to your twisted updo.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt5894m6fcrgs.jpg><h3>22. Crown updo with spiral braid</h3><p class=align-left>The braid which is involved in this hairstyle offers you some difference. It starts from the back of your ear and then goes around the head until reaching the top. The hairstyle is cute and very easy to construct on your own once you have some practice. And it will look incredibly unique in the photos.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt6hro6430178.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Trendy hairstyles with wool - embrace your beauty</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt1nn3oo5kotu8.jpg><h3>23.

The curls will be your pride, and the braids will bring visual interest for people.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkytcqea2n3t8to.jpg><h3>25.
