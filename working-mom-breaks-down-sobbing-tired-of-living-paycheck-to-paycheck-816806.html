But due to&nbsp;the current economic situation, nowadays even people with well-paying jobs can struggle to&nbsp;make ends meet. Mackenzie Moan, a&nbsp;working mom of&nbsp;2&nbsp;kids, decided to&nbsp;bravely share with the world the struggles her <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> has to&nbsp;face, despite all their best efforts.</p><p><h2>Mackenzie Moan is&nbsp;a&nbsp;mom and nurse.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cda/615/27751d58d1afa04f81dbe37636.jpg><p>Mackenzie Moan, a&nbsp;mother of&nbsp;2&nbsp;from Pennsylvania, USA, manages a&nbsp;demanding schedule as&nbsp;a&nbsp;full-time critical care nurse. Simultaneously, she pursues her graduate degree and diligently cares for her children. Balancing work, <a href=# title=education data-link=tag>education</a>, and parenting, Moan demonstrates exceptional dedication. But despite all of&nbsp;her efforts to&nbsp;offer her family the best life possible, the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>young mom</a> often struggles to&nbsp;make ends meet. Frustrated by&nbsp;the situation, she turned to&nbsp;<a href=# title=TikTok data-link=tag>TikTok</a> to&nbsp;vent.</p><p><h2>The woman went viral after she posted a&nbsp;candid video about her family’s struggles.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a15/5ab/c313f85660b7a004227c03a20f.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the heart-breaking video, posted by&nbsp;TikTok user <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mackmoan1988</a>, the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>woman</a> can be&nbsp;seen breaking down in&nbsp;tears over the difficult situation she has to&nbsp;face. Moan expressed her feelings in&nbsp;a&nbsp;TikTok video, tearfully sharing, “I&nbsp;feel like my&nbsp;husband and&nbsp;I are doing everything right. We&nbsp;both have good jobs, I’m a&nbsp;registered nurse who works full-time, he&nbsp;works full-time.” This heartfelt message was posted on&nbsp;November 14&nbsp;and has garnered an&nbsp;impressive 1.5 million views.</p><p><h2>Despite both Moan and her husband working full-time, the parents face financial difficulties every month.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/224/c20/fa1ffa58bc993b25b7f6ea21ae.jpg><p>Moan clarified that, four days following the receipt and settlement of&nbsp;their <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>paychecks</a>, she and her husband found themselves with approximately $200 to&nbsp;$300 for the subsequent 10&nbsp;days after covering their bills. She underscored that they reside in&nbsp;a&nbsp;modest three-bedroom house with one bathroom. Additionally, Moan highlighted that both she and her partner earn a&nbsp;substantial income, emphasizing that they are mindful not to&nbsp;exceed their means.</p><p>Throughout her academic journey, Mackenzie Moan remembered reassuring herself with the belief that things would improve after graduating and entering the workforce. Reflecting on&nbsp;her expectations, she expressed, “I&nbsp;thought I’d be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;pay my&nbsp;bills and not have to&nbsp;check my&nbsp;bank account if&nbsp;my&nbsp;kids say, ’Mom, can we&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the movies this weekend?’ I&nbsp;thought we’d be&nbsp;comfortable and we’re not, at&nbsp;all. Growing up&nbsp;we&nbsp;were told, ’Go to&nbsp;<a href=# title=college data-link=tag>college</a>, get a&nbsp;degree, work to&nbsp;support your family.’ Here we&nbsp;are. Did that, now what?”</p><p><h2>Many people empathized with the working mom, sharing their own experiences.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/358/a8f/dd26cd5a17bf21f4373505c1d8.jpg><p>Mackenzie Moan’s video garnered significant attention, accumulating numerous views and generating considerable engagement with thousands of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>comments</a> from people who resonated with her experiences. “We&nbsp;have 98&nbsp;cents in&nbsp;our savings. It’s so&nbsp;rough out here. We&nbsp;are all depressed and drowning,” someone shared. While another person noted: “The fact that everyone is&nbsp;struggling should say something, this is&nbsp;so&nbsp;sad.”</p><p>Later, the mom of&nbsp;2&nbsp;also posted some follow-up videos, clarifying the situation and addressing people’s reactions. In&nbsp;one of&nbsp;them she reassured people that just because she has to&nbsp;deal with a&nbsp;stressful situation, that doesn’t mean she’s not grateful for what she has. “I&nbsp;know I’m in&nbsp;a&nbsp;much better situation than a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;people, I&nbsp;get that, because I’ve been on&nbsp;the other side. I’ve been there and I’m extremely grateful for what&nbsp;I have and what&nbsp;I worked for. Yes, I&nbsp;am extremely fortunate to&nbsp;have all of&nbsp;those things but I’m still allowed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;stressed out about our financial situation,” Moan <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>concluded</a>.</p><p>Many people have to&nbsp;deal with financial difficulties, which compels some elderly folk to&nbsp;work even after they hit the retirement age. Thanks to&nbsp;the kidness of&nbsp;a&nbsp;stranger who saw her, Nola, a&nbsp;82-year-old <a href=#>woman</a> who was still working at&nbsp;a&nbsp;supermarket, was finally able to&nbsp;quit her job.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSwvsqipaBlnaS6bq7Rnpikq12ZvLi6jKymm5qZo7RuwMirnJ1ln5t6rbXVoqWgZaCWxqS0xJyiZqyfYr2ixcKhnJyjXW1%2Bd4SPb2Y%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sarah-paulson-niecy-nash-betts-naomi-watts-ryan-murphy-hulu-alls-fair-1236096568.html><span>←</span><span></span></a>
