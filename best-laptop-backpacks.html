A genuinely great laptop bag will have a dedicated pocket to cradle your computer in its own padded section, plus plenty of organization options and other attractive perks like an ergonomic design, durable construction, and an array of eye-catching colors to choose from. With so many laptop backpacks on the market—ranging from under $50 to well over $200—and a huge selection of brands, styles, and sizes out there, it’ll take a bit of shopping around to find exactly what you need.</p><p>There isn’t one perfect bag for everyone, but we’ve researched and tested an assortment of models to find the greatest laptop backpacks of 2023 for day trips, frequent travel, college students, and everything in between.</p><h2 id=what-to-consider-when-buying-a-laptop-backpack>What to consider when buying a laptop backpack</h2><p>Although there isn’t a one-size-fits-all best laptop backpack, there are a few key questions to consider while shopping around to make sure that you buy the best one for your travel needs:</p><h3>Is the backpack a good fit for my laptop?</h3><p>The most important aspect of any laptop backpack is whether or not it will hold and protect your PC. Look for laptop backpacks with a spacious, well-padded pocket and a soft interior fabric to ensure that it will be protected from bumps, movement, and accidental drops.</p><p>Be sure to check the manufacturer’s website to see the maximum laptop size the bag was designed for, since you don’t want one that will either barely fit or jostle around inside a huge pouch. Backpacks designed so that their laptop pouches don’t encroach on the main compartment are especially useful, as they allow you to easily pack more tech accessories and essential travel items. If you’re having a difficult time choosing between several backpacks that may comfortably fit your laptop, look out for models sporting additional pockets, mesh bags, and zippered compartments to store even more stuff.</p><h3>Will the backpack be comfortable?</h3><p>Since most people tend to keep a backpack for a long time, you’ll want to find one that will be comfortable while you’re waiting for your flight, or moving to and from the office. Laptop backpacks with breathable mesh cushions and straps, ergonomic “S”-shaped arm straps, and those available in multiple size options so you can select one that fits your body type, all indicate that the manufacturer designed them with your comfort in mind.</p><h3>Was the backpack designed with organization in mind?</h3><p>This is a trickier aspect to identify at a glance, but just because a laptop backpack has a lot of pockets, doesn’t mean that it will be simple to organize. A few hints that a backpack was made for orderly packing include the ability to unzip its exterior, so that its sides expand outward into a butterfly shape, letting you place items exactly where you want them; many conveniently placed compartments in multiple types for various fragile, small, and other item types; and a series of clearly marked components for shoes, dirty clothes, or a water bottle.</p><h3>Is this backpack made to last?</h3><p>Generally speaking, a great laptop backpack will give you many years of use, but some are certainly more durable than others. It’s important that you buy a backpack that was built to last not just because you want to get your money’s worth, but because it needs to protect your laptop when it counts. Some key signs of a truly rugged laptop bag include waterproof/resistant and tear-resistant materials, as well as heavy-duty zippers.</p><h3>Does this backpack match my style?</h3><p>Even when you finally discover the ultimate backpack that does everything you need it to do and beyond, it’s a good idea to hold off on buying just a little longer, to check whether it’s available in alternate colors and styles that fit your aesthetic. Many laptop backpacks are offered in a spectrum of vibrant hues, and some brands give customers the chance to customize their pack with their favorite color combination for that extra special touch.</p><h2 id=our-top-laptop-backpack-picks>Our top laptop backpack picks</h2><h3>Best budget laptop backpack: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Osprey Flare</a></h3><a rel=nofollow href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61NDVWwvcRL._AC_SX679_.jpg alt="Osprey Flare" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><p>Osprey demonstrates that you can absolutely find a quality bag without breaking the bank, with their all-around solid Flare laptop backpack.

This particularly tough bag includes many smaller compartments for easy organization, while the mesh padding running along the straps and back cushions make it comfortable to wear while avoiding skin contact with its admittedly rough-to-the-touch rainproof materials.

Whether we took a day trip across town or a cross-country trek, we carried around a backpack loaded with a laptop and personal belongings to see how they felt, how easy they were to organize, and how they held up over time. Only a few stood out as our favorites, and out of those, each model that made our list excelled in a specific area, such as affordability, style, or versatility, but our top laptop bags also met and exceeded the following criteria:</p><p><strong>Laptop-friendly design</strong>: We only tested backpacks designed with designated laptop pockets. Those with plush compartments, room for laptop accessories, and a layer of water resistance quickly rose to the top of the list.</p><p><strong>Durability</strong>: If we’re going to trust a backpack to carry not only our laptops, but our other important tech, it has to be built to last. After being thrown into cars, dropped (by accident,) and hauled about on our daily adventures, we can vouch for these rock-solid travel backpacks.</p><p><strong>Comfort</strong>: We would never recommend a backpack that gave us neck or back strain, and although some were far cozier to wear for long periods of time than others, these all passed our comfort test.</p><p><strong>Organizability</strong>: The best backpacks were designed to tidily organize your stuff in a collection of pouches, zippered pockets, and mesh sacks. A quality laptop section is an absolute must, but backpacks with accessible storage for a water bottle, clothes, extra electronics, and everything else stood out from the competition.</p><p><strong>Customizability and personality</strong>: There are countless backpacks on the market, but those available in a rainbow of cool colors and highly customizable designs will make it that much easier to identify your unique laptop backpack on a crowded airport security conveyor belt.</p><p><strong>Affordability</strong>: All of the laptop backpacks we selected are sold from below $50 to nearly $300, but not only is it easy to find a bag to perfectly suit your travel needs for well under that top price point, diligent shoppers can find a few good picks for surprisingly cheap.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>Who makes the best laptop backpacks?</h3><p>Every brand on our list makes top-quality laptop backpacks, each with their own specialty. For example:</p><ul><li>Thule and JanSport have a reputation for making quality laptop backpacks for students. Samsonite and Nomatic are premium selections for frequent travelers. Cotopaxi and Tucano are known for their vibrant and stylish backpack designs.</li></ul><h3>What should I look for in a tech backpack?</h3><p>Frequent travelers who rely on their laptop backpacks for work or entertainment should look out for these handy features:</p><ul><li>A wireless charging pocket to hold an external battery, so you can continue using your laptop as it charges during lengthy flights and road trips.</li><li>A USB port so you can charge your laptop while it’s safely stored inside your backpack.</li><li>A cable management pocket designed to conveniently carry your laptop’s charging cables and power brick.</li><li>And most importantly, a well-padded laptop RFID-protected pocket, to shield your device from everyday bumps and drops.</li></ul><h3>What is better for a laptop, a bag or backpack?</h3><p>Both laptop bags and backpacks have their pros and cons. A backpack is the superior option for traveling with a laptop with a lot of other tech, and for those who appreciate the convenience of carrying their gear on their back.</p><p>Conversely, if you are traveling with just your computer and minimal extras, a hardshell laptop bag will likely be the lighter and slimmer option.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lnJa9tbvPZpmam5ulrqS30mg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./basset-hound.html><span>←</span><span>Basset Hound popularity &amp;amp; fame</span></a>
