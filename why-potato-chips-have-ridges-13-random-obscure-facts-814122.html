Imagine you are with friends watching a&nbsp;film and you are eating chips. Would you prefer to&nbsp;dip non-ruffled chips or&nbsp;a&nbsp;ruffled one?</p><p>Non-ruffled ones cannot handle the weight of&nbsp;the sauce and break down. Bamm! You have sauce all over your white t-shirt. So&nbsp;ruffled chips win! Ruffled chips also give you a&nbsp;better mouth feel.</p><p>Potato chips have a&nbsp;prominent oil taste which decreases the potato taste. And you might have fingers oil-covered. Where is&nbsp;the fun in&nbsp;that? So, what do&nbsp;you prefer? Ridges or&nbsp;regular potato chips?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/4f6/c89/4254df5c56ad55f8afeaf11b8f.png><p>Barcodes made our lives so&nbsp;much easier. But do&nbsp;you know how they work? Zebra lines are the keys here. Barcodes are read using a&nbsp;scanner. The scanner has a&nbsp;laser that detects the pattern. The laser reads the barcode. The barcode absorbs some light, and the rest is&nbsp;reflected.</p><p>The computer can make sense of&nbsp;those dots, lines, and numbers on&nbsp;a&nbsp;barcode. Imagine black and white lines as&nbsp;0’s and 1’s. Black observes the light, and white reflects&nbsp;it. This rule applies here. The black parts of&nbsp;the 1s&nbsp;and the white parts that reflect the lights are 0s. The scanner sees the white sections, not the black parts.</p><p>Post-its are our friendly reminders to&nbsp;visit the dentist or&nbsp;a&nbsp;scheduled meeting. Be&nbsp;sure to&nbsp;hang them on&nbsp;the wall firmly. We&nbsp;have been using Post-It Notes wrong this whole time.</p><p>You are not supposed to&nbsp;peel it&nbsp;off from the bottom. Because this creates a&nbsp;crease in&nbsp;the paper. The note won’t hold on&nbsp;to&nbsp;the surface for long. Take it&nbsp;off from the side. It’ll stick more powerfully.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/042/53f/cf2075535db4543d4130c83efe.png><p>Cloud-like and sweet... The one and onlyyy cotton candy. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;irresistible, especially for young people. “Too much sugar is&nbsp;bad for the teeth,” everyone heard this phrase from their dentists. Surprise. The inventor of&nbsp;cotton candy is&nbsp;a&nbsp;dentist.</p><p>So, cotton candy was invented in&nbsp;1895 by&nbsp;John C. Wharton, a&nbsp;candy maker, and William Morrison, a&nbsp;dentist. They named their product “fairy floss”. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;cool name, by&nbsp;the way. They sold thousands of&nbsp;cotton candy at&nbsp;the St. Louis World’s Fair in&nbsp;1904. Cotton candy is&nbsp;still with&nbsp;us, showing up&nbsp;in&nbsp;amusement parks, and dentists still care for people with tooth decay. Some things never change.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you love a&nbsp;lollipop? Why are there tiny holes in&nbsp;it? Those two holes in&nbsp;a&nbsp;lollipop stick may be&nbsp;used as&nbsp;a&nbsp;simple whistle. But they are there to&nbsp;hold the candy in&nbsp;place. The stick is&nbsp;dipped in&nbsp;the liquid syrup. It&nbsp;flows into the holes, solidifies, and surrounds the stick.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/5d6/bfc/3b497b5e39a2a6a3b4b7263d56.png><p>A&nbsp;life-changing invention is&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=refrigerator data-link=tag>refrigerator</a>. But not everybody knows it&nbsp;has a&nbsp;dark story behind its door. The Refrigerator Safety Act was launched in&nbsp;August 1956 to&nbsp;prevent young people from being trapped inside a&nbsp;household refrigerator.</p><p>The refrigerators used to&nbsp;have an&nbsp;external latch that shut the refrigerator door when it&nbsp;was not in&nbsp;use. It&nbsp;can only be&nbsp;open from the outside. You can relax. After this regulation, household refrigerators were manufactured to&nbsp;be&nbsp;opened from the inside.</p><p>Moving on&nbsp;to&nbsp;the kitchen from the bathroom... Using the <a href=# title=toilet data-link=tag>toilet</a> while scrolling down the Instagram feed is&nbsp;taken for granted. Guess what? More people in&nbsp;the world have phones than toilets. According to&nbsp;a&nbsp;UN report, billions of&nbsp;people lack access to&nbsp;a&nbsp;toilet, especially in&nbsp;areas of&nbsp;South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. The number of&nbsp;mobile phone owners outnumbers those with proper plumbing and sanitized toilets.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/197/40f/bf92755255bb961edc47f59e5b.png><p>Also, scientists have found that cell phones carry 10&nbsp;times more bacteria than most toilet seats. So&nbsp;yeah, you might want to&nbsp;sanitize your phone after watching this video.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you use FaceTime or&nbsp;Skype to&nbsp;talk to&nbsp;each other worldwide? It&nbsp;could be&nbsp;for a&nbsp;chat, a&nbsp;meeting, or&nbsp;something else. The webcam technology was born with a&nbsp;very reasonable goal, though. In&nbsp;1993, researchers at&nbsp;the computer science department at&nbsp;the University of&nbsp;Cambridge set up&nbsp;a&nbsp;system to&nbsp;see if&nbsp;the coffee pot was empty or&nbsp;not. Yes, you heard it&nbsp;right.</p><p>Researchers needed coffee to&nbsp;fuel their brains, as&nbsp;many of&nbsp;us do. They get up&nbsp;from their chairs, go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the coffee pot, and find it&nbsp;empty. Instead of&nbsp;making sure that someone makes fresh coffee, they wired up&nbsp;a&nbsp;system. The system would stream the images of&nbsp;the room where the coffee pot was kept.</p><p>At&nbsp;that time, it&nbsp;was 3&nbsp;pictures taken per minute. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;more than enough to&nbsp;see if&nbsp;the pot has coffee in&nbsp;it&nbsp;or&nbsp;not. Thanks to&nbsp;the researchers for not getting up&nbsp;from their chairs. And for another tiny thing; coming up&nbsp;with this brilliant idea!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/436/dbd/ef02fc5bd9b8344222186d0d9e.png><p>Do&nbsp;you buy white eggs or&nbsp;brown eggs? What is&nbsp;the difference besides the color? Since brown eggs tend to&nbsp;cost more, you might think that something in&nbsp;them makes the prices a&nbsp;bit higher. Nope.</p><p>The color of&nbsp;the eggshell doesn’t affect its nutrition or&nbsp;quality. Both eggs are healthy. Brown eggs cost more because the hens that lay them need more feed. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;more pricey to&nbsp;raise them than the white egg hens. The cost is&nbsp;reflected on&nbsp;to&nbsp;the consumer.</p><p>There is&nbsp;a&nbsp;hole in&nbsp;the handle of&nbsp;some kitchen pots and pans. We&nbsp;mostly use this hole to&nbsp;place the kitchen utility vertically on&nbsp;a&nbsp;cabinet door. They have a&nbsp;second way of&nbsp;use. Imagine you are cooking multiple dishes to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;feast for the family.</p><p>The kitchen counter is&nbsp;full of&nbsp;stuff. You have a&nbsp;hard time finding a&nbsp;place for the gravy sauce spoon. You can place the spoon in&nbsp;the hole at&nbsp;the edge of&nbsp;the saucepan handle. It&nbsp;will stay there safely until you decide to&nbsp;stir the sauce again. Not every spoon fits into the hole. It&nbsp;might easily slide to&nbsp;the floor. Better to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;test run when the spoon is&nbsp;clean.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/f85/f7d/c784bc5c0c86d3d24c60c02bbd.png><p>Imagine you have a&nbsp;takeaway of&nbsp;a&nbsp;noodle with extra topping on&nbsp;your way home. You recently moved, and all plates are in&nbsp;the boxes. You struggle with this noodle box. The toppings are stuck at&nbsp;the bottom. The sauce didn’t mix evenly either.</p><p>We&nbsp;have missed out on&nbsp;an&nbsp;easier way to&nbsp;eat from the take-out boxes. They can be&nbsp;flat and serve as&nbsp;plates. You take the edges of&nbsp;the paper out and open it&nbsp;up. There you&nbsp;go. Now you have a&nbsp;plate. The best part is&nbsp;you don’t have to&nbsp;clean it&nbsp;up&nbsp;afterward.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you know that a&nbsp;tomato is&nbsp;not a&nbsp;veggie but a&nbsp;fruit? So&nbsp;is&nbsp;avocado. Watermelon is&nbsp;actually a&nbsp;berry. There is&nbsp;more to&nbsp;that! Peanuts are not in&nbsp;the nuts family. They are different from almonds and cashews. Peanut pods grow under the soil. They are harvested like potatoes.</p><p>Their upper parts are like bushes. These tasty siders are not classified as&nbsp;nuts since they grow under the ground, not on&nbsp;a&nbsp;tree. They pulled up&nbsp;from the soil like carrots. Next time you eat peanuts in&nbsp;a&nbsp;friend circle, you can mention this new fact you heard! Or&nbsp;it&nbsp;can be&nbsp;an&nbsp;icebreaker when you see someone eating peanuts. Classifying food as&nbsp;fruit or&nbsp;vegetable is&nbsp;a&nbsp;tricky business.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/f11/0ca/b67c0b5af3b3857b04d042aee4.png><p>Do&nbsp;you know who invented T-shirts? In&nbsp;1904, the Cooper Underwear Company prepared an&nbsp;ad&nbsp;and introduced its new product with “before” and “after” photos. It&nbsp;was referred to&nbsp;as&nbsp;an&nbsp;“undershirt”. The slogan was “No&nbsp;safety pins&nbsp;— no&nbsp;buttons&nbsp;— no&nbsp;needle&nbsp;— no&nbsp;thread”. As&nbsp;the name revealed, they were worn under the clothes.</p><p>One day it&nbsp;was announced that sailors should wear undershirts with no&nbsp;buttons under their uniforms. T-shirt love spread like pollen at&nbsp;a&nbsp;park on&nbsp;a&nbsp;spring day. Soon thousands of&nbsp;men started wearing them. Though t-shirts go&nbsp;back to&nbsp;the 19th century, now we&nbsp;have all adjusted to&nbsp;the comfort of&nbsp;our cozy t-shirts. Do&nbsp;you also wear T-shirts like the sailors?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSpxYyppq2ZpKR6pLTIqapmoJGrsm6%2ByJ2enqtdZoBuvsCnm6ilXaSvtK%2FUq5xmnpGYwbR5l2prampiZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1586420-utme-2024-jamb-sends-message-candidates-reactivation-profile-code.html><span>←</span><span>UTME 2024: JAMB Sends Message to Candidates on Reactivation of Profile Code</span></a>
