When you consider that 1.8 million people reach working age each year, it’s clear this is still not enough, but I believe the target will be reached soon.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>As for opportunity, Africa needs to play to its strengths. Africa could be a global leader in agriculture and it is desperately important that young people are encouraged to stay in this sector. This means creating real career opportunities, where people can get promoted, learn new skills, take better advantage of technology.</p><p>Africans are also excellent innovators; just look at M-Pesa, the mobile payments firm. It is no surprise to me that the businesses that are really making an impact in the consumer space right now are African, rather than consumer brands.</p><p>For me, the most important revolution needed is in the area of skills. The global economy has come to Africa. Trade is now no longer reserved to commodities and raw materials; we are now trading technology, clothing, and financial services. This makes it more important than ever that young Africans get the skills they need to play a role in this revolution.</p><p>At our meeting this week in Abuja, we will launch the African Skills Initiative; to help leaders deliver the best skills training so our youth can compete in the global marketplace.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>This is a very good question. We all know how important entertainment is to Africans but I confess, I was surprised as anyone to learn that Nollywood is now Nigeria’s biggest employer outside of agriculture. This has been a remarkable private sector success story that shows the depth of entrepreneurial talent we have in this continent. I’m looking forward to meeting D’Banj at our meeting this week and we will certainly talk about whether there is room for greater public-private collaboration as a way of driving the sector forward further.</p><p>We’re very excited about a number of initiatives. First, I have to mention “Grow Africa”, which has been running for three years now and has already helped over 2.5 million farmers in Africa improve their livelihood. Last week, we announced that it has now raised over $7 billion, so this revolution in agriculture has only just begun.</p><p>Then there is the Skills Initiative I mentioned. We are also looking at ways of helping countries get financing for the massive infrastructure projects – water supply, power and roads mainly – that Africa so badly needs. For me, one of the most exciting things about our meetings are the ideas that come out of them that might not have even been considered, which we then help take forward by pulling together a team of committed stakeholders to develop. You’ve already given me an excellent idea, entertainment: maybe we’ll be talking about this at our 2015 meeting.</p><p>We chose Nigeria frankly because it was high time we had a meeting here. Roughly one in four sub-Saharan Africans is Nigerian, it has the largest economy in Africa and yet it remains still relatively unknown to many of our partners and constituents. The fact that we have more of our strategic partners – these are the big, global companies that we engage with most regularly on a year-round business – coming to this meeting than any other we have held in Africa demonstrates the level of interest the country is attracting among investors.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>This interest will translate into investments that will generate jobs. But more important is bringing investment that provides good quality jobs; jobs with real career prospects, training opportunities and a good environment to work in. What is most important though is that leaders come away from this meeting with a clearer idea on how to build growing economies that don’t leave anyone behind: that prioritize better education, healthcare, roads and safety. Governments have indicated they want to listen, and business wants to help. It is these kinds of partnerships that deliver real benefits to our youth.</p><p>The problems happening in Nigeria are exactly the reason why we need to be here. This meeting is not the priority for Nigerians right now and nor should it be: bringing back the schoolgirls is everybody’s topmost concern. But the problems being experienced here and sadly in other parts of Africa just show how vitally important it is that we manage to find solutions for the problems we have in society. Nobody wants an Africa where one is afraid to walk the streets or go to school: it is up to all stakeholders – government, business and society – to work together to build a better, more inclusive future for all of us. This is our mission: it’s what we’re here to do.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkvba40p5knrCTocK0tdWeZG5lnZ67tsDErGSwoaSdeqa40qKcZqORo8eieceemJ1ln5t6orLRopqaZaekv62wjJ6aqKaforakecWoqa6lX5x%2FuH6Ubqs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./warner-bros-discovery-ceo-david-zaslav-tough-tactics-nba-cnn-1236106600.html><span>←</span><span>Warner Bros.
