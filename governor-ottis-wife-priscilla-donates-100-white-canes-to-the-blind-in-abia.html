He solicited support for the indigent members of the association who, he said, dropped out from secondary school due to the lack of sponsorship.</p><p>"We wish to plead with Governor Alex Otti, to help us replace our set of musical band, which outlived its useful life, and got damaged. This is one of the means through which our unemployed youths, who are skilled in this area, help themselves and the association," he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0mijqJuRoXyou9WeqaenomK8tcDIrGSwoZaaerG%2ByKyaoqSclnqlu82aq56rXWZ9cXnWoaCtnV2Yrq%2Bx0marqGWknbJursuipZ1lmaN6oq7ImmaecaqauanE</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./marches-publics-deux-projets-de-decret-examines-en-conseil-des-ministres.html><span>←</span><span>deux projets de dcret examins en Conseil des ministres</span></a>
