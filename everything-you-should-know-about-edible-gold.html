It is said that the people in far Eastern civilisation ate gold to either summon their gods’ favour or to look like them, since their gods were made with gold.</p><p>The Japanese were also popular for using edible gold for food decorations and the Europeans in the Middle Age used to throw huge parties with gold-decorated foods.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-10>Is it safe for eating?</h3></p><p>Edible gold is considered chemically inert, and it has been officially declared as non-toxic. So it is definitely safe for consumption.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-12>What does it taste like?</h3></p><p>It is safe to say, gold is eaten mostly for the aesthetics and not for the taste. This is because edible gold is basically tasteless. It has no flavour of its own and mostly eaten for luxury or some perceived health benefits.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-14>Health benefits of edible gold</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>It is said that gold comes with some health benefits such as treating respiratory conditions, arthritis and may help improve the immune system. For edible gold however, it is not absorbed during the digestive process and while it is safe to eat, there are no nutritional health benefits associated with its consumption.</p><p>Now you are more familiar with edible gold, are you adding this to your diet anytime soon?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOwu8Nmq6uZppq5cLHVnqmyrJieu6h52KisZquYpMKtsIykpaivXZavsMHTZpydoZKhsm6zzqWbaG6ir7u3r9A%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./5-historical-legends-in-the-nigerian-culture-everyone-should-know-about.html><span>←</span><span>5 Historical legends in the Nigerian culture everyone should know about</span></a>
