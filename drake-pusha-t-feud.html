The latest two rappers to rise to the fore of the feud landscape are <a href=#>Drake</a> and Pusha-T, who over Memorial Day weekend began trading insults back and forth. Pusha-T (real name: Terrence LeVarr Thornton) is hot off the heels of releasing a new seven-track album, Daytona, on May 25, while Drake (real name: Aubrey Drake Graham) has been hyping up the June drop of his expected album Scorpion, the follow-up to 2017’s chart-blasting <a href=#>More Life</a> “playlist.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Drake and Pusha-T have a long history of beef, dating back <a href=# rel=noopener>to the early 2010s</a> and inter-label disputes — mostly Pusha-T tracks that criticized Drake for his loyalty to Lil Wayne and suggested a connection to a ghostwriter. (Drake’s label boss Lil Wayne is not <a href=# rel=noopener>a Pusha-T fan</a>.) That sparked a back-and-forth between the two artists for years.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The association made headlines on Friday, however, with Pusha-T’s Daytona release. The closing song, “Infrared,” <a href=# rel=noopener>takes shots at Drake:</a> “It was written like Nas but it came from Quentin,” he raps, making a reference to Quentin Miller, who Meek Mill alleged ghost wrote a number of songs for Drake. Miller <a href=# rel=noopener>has denied</a> that allegation in the past.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In response, Drake released his own freestyle rap on Soundcloud, “Duppy Freestyle,” on May 26. “I’m in shock,” he starts off the top. “The nerve, the audacity.” Then he rebuts Pusha-T’s claims, making digs at the other rapper’s talent and relationship to Kanye West. (Pusha-T says West, currently in the midst of his own <a href=#>controversial moment</a> around comments <a href=#>he’s made</a> on Twitter, <a href=# rel=noopener>guided Daytona</a>. Pusha <a href=# rel=noopener>has said that</a> he disagrees with West’s politics.) “Don’t push me when I’m in album mode,” Drake warns <a href=# rel=noopener>in “Duppy Freestyle.”</a> “You not even top 5 as far as your label talent goes / You send shots, well, I got to challenge those.” He signed off asking to be compensated for the free publicity: “Send the invoice for the extra 20…”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Pusha-T fanned the flames by tweeting out Drake’s song, with that final lyric as his tweet. Drake responded by sharing an Instagram of an invoice for $100,000 for “promotional assistance and career reviving,” to be paid by G.O.O.D. Music/Def Jam (Pusha-T and West’s label) to OVO Sound, Drake’s label.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">That, however, was not the end. On Tuesday, Pusha-T released “The Story of Adidon,” another diss track rapped over <a href=#>Jay-Z’s “The Story of O.J.” beat</a>. The art for the song appears to be a picture of Drake in blackface, wearing a shirt and hoodie emblazoned with cartoon Jim Crow images. Some, <a href=# rel=noopener>including Billboard</a>, have speculated that the image was originally intended as a form of social commentary, possibly by a <a href=# rel=noopener>Toronto clothing brand.</a> Devoid of context, the photo <a href=# rel=noopener>proved jarring to many</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But later on Wednesday, Drake took to Instagram to <a href=# rel=noopener>address</a> the picture, explaining the photo from 2007 was taken for a project centered on “how African Americans were once wrongfully portrayed in entertainment.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As for the rap in the track itself, “The Story of Adidon” is full of increasingly personal digs at Drake, including the assertion that Drake has a secret child. He also calls out Drake’s dad, his producer’s battle with multiple sclerosis and Drake’s own racial identity. “Let’s have a heart-to-heart about your pride / Even though you’re multi, I see that your soul don’t look alive,” <a href=# rel=noopener>Pusha-T raps.</a> “Confused, always felt you weren’t Black enough / Afraid to grow it ’cause your ‘fro wouldn’t nap enough.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Representatives for both Pusha-T and Drake declined to comment to TIME for this story.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZuamlqgXiFjp2pmqOVYr22v8eaZK1llprCpXs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-to-read-5-bible-verses-on-loving-your-neighbor-as-yourself.html><span>←</span><span>5 Bible verses on loving your neighbor as yourself</span></a>
