The circus performer is bringing something totally new to the stage with a leviwand act that will blow your mind. Will this incredible act win Ehrlich the $1 million prize?</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ehrlich-performs-masterful-leviwand-act-on-the-america-s-got-talent-stage>Ehrlich Performs Masterful Leviwand Act on the ‘America’s Got Talent’ Stage</h2><p>Ehrlich is a master of leviwand, the manipulation of an object to make it seem like it is floating. He is a huge fan of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Heidi Klum</a> but really wants to impress <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Simon Cowell</a> because he knows how hard it is to do so.&nbsp;For Ehrlich, performing on America’s Got Talent is a huge dream come true. Before stepping out onto the America’s Got Talent stage Ehrlich, shared a tearful FaceTime call with some of his closest supporters.</p><p>“I gave up everything to pursue my performing,” Ehrlich told the judges. “People thought I was crazy. I didn’t think I’ll make it here. But my friends and family, they supported me and they inspired me to fight. I’m here fighting for myself, my family, my friends, my community, my country and it is the dream to be here, the biggest stage in the world.”</p><p>The lights dimmed and the judges were instantly wowed by the magic Ehrlich created up on stage. He started off with his leviwands, twirling the glow-in-the-dark batons without using his hands. This act is a combination of the allure of magic and stunning dancing. At the end of the act, Ehrlich pulled out a glow-in-the-dark hula hoop and was able to master both the baton and the hula hoop at the same time.&nbsp;He calls this technique the “satellite.”</p><p>loading="lazy"</p><br><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-has-performed-his-incredible-act-with-cirque-du-soleil>He Has Performed His Incredible Act with Cirque du Soleil</h2><p>Ehrlich began dancing in 2005. His talents also include spinning poi, a skill that we might see him perform if he does get voted through to the next round of the competition. In 2013, Ehrlich discovered leviwand and was completely hooked right away. Two years later, he developed his act to include hula hoops. This passionate performer will only be using one hula hoop for his America’s Got Talent audition but can work up to six hula hoops at a time.</p><p>“What I love about being a&nbsp;#leviwand performer: the opportunity to dress up, have fun with my acts, and inspire others to be their own&nbsp;#heroes,” Ehrlich <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>wrote on Instagram.</a></p><p>He represented the Philippines at the 36th Festival Mondial du Cirque de Demain in Paris in 2016. In 2019, Ehrlich got to perform his mesmerizing act with Cirque du Soleil&nbsp;in the show Syma. He also performed with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>Cirque du Soleil at Sea</a> aboard the MSC Bellissima. Due to the pandemic, MSC cruises all came to a halt, forcing Ehrlich to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>return home to the Philippines.</a></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CDyt_3Rhr9D/</p></figure><p>In 2020, Ehrlich announced on Instagram that he had landed himself <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>a contract with Circus Conelli</a> in Zurich for 2022. Some of his full on-stage performances leading up to this announcement are posted on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">his YouTube page. </a>His talents aren’t just limited to leviwand and hula hoops. Ehrlich is big on teaching others his craft as a choreographer and workshop leader.</p><p>He offers <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">so many resources online</a> on how to start leviwand and courses including a course called “Ehrlich’s Leviwand&nbsp; Method.” Ehrlich has used his story as a was to inspire others as a motivational speaker. He took his act all the way from the streets of Manila to performing for the circus.</p><p>To see Ehrlich’s full America’s Got Talent audition, tune in to NBC at 8 p.m. ET on Tuesday.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/0004-4141191723_20210711_000739_0000.jpeg alt="‘The Four’s Evvie Mckinney Welcomes Baby Girl" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>America's Got Talent</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wqKpnK2jYr2mvsWoqaadomKyqb7LopqhZZKntq%2Bz0masp6GhqrJuuMSvoLCZnpl6oq%2FTZquoZZGisrO1wpqqZp%2BfqXq1rcuepa1n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alain-rousset-extremement-touche.html><span>←</span><span>Alain Rousset &amp;quot;extrmement touch&amp;quot;</span></a>
