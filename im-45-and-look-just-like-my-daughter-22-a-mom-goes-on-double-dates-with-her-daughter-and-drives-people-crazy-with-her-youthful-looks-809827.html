Glowing on&nbsp;the beach in&nbsp;their bikinis, the ladies looked just like twins.</p><p>People of&nbsp;Instagram couldn’t remain indifferent to&nbsp;the phenomenon and showered the mom with compliments. Despite their 24-year age gap, these <a href=# title=California data-link=tag>California</a> girls are used to&nbsp;being mistaken for sisters. Joleen says that her daughter doesn’t mind being compared to&nbsp;her mom in&nbsp;age.</p><p>She explains, “While she was growing&nbsp;up, she would often hear people tell me&nbsp;they thought my&nbsp;mother was my&nbsp;sister.” So, as&nbsp;we&nbsp;see, this feature is&nbsp;not new in&nbsp;their family.</p><p><h2>Joleen’s youthful looks even bring her unexpected trouble sometimes.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/28c/5fb/53c5cf584f849dfb9841bdbee8.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c1f/600/1ded6c5b3e89eef5610dca9e9c.jpg><p>Joleen Diaz used to&nbsp;work as&nbsp;a&nbsp;high school teacher and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>moved</a> to&nbsp;California when she was 10. The woman has been single since splitting from her husband and daughter Meilani’s father.</p><p>Now, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;real star on&nbsp;Instagram, she has younger men reaching out to&nbsp;her in&nbsp;her DMs on&nbsp;a&nbsp;regular basis. She claims that her youthful appearance made people report her Hinge profile because they thought she was a&nbsp;catfish. “I’ve had my&nbsp;account deleted several times,” the woman said. “It’s funny, I&nbsp;think people think I’m a&nbsp;fake account and report&nbsp;me.”</p><p><h2>The twin-like duo is&nbsp;more than just mom and daughter.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/856/035/bea818594ea96c413c5e5a503e.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/688/eaf/8ec0ed5efe8f6bb0ddd2b5a0b2.jpg><p>Now, the lookalike mother and daughter both <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>have</a> profiles on&nbsp;various dating apps. They often go&nbsp;on&nbsp;double dates and even like to&nbsp;approve of&nbsp;each other’s potential partners.</p><p>“When we&nbsp;are both seeing people, we&nbsp;will often go&nbsp;bowling, to&nbsp;the movies, hikes, to&nbsp;the beach,” Joleen said in&nbsp;her interview. “Meilani asks for my&nbsp;advice on&nbsp;dating all the time. I&nbsp;love that she trusts in&nbsp;the advice I&nbsp;give. I&nbsp;feel like she’s well-balanced in&nbsp;dating and I’m glad my&nbsp;experiences can help her out.”</p><p><h2>The young-looking mom claims the Internet gives off the wrong impression of&nbsp;her.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6ec/43f/278ff65280b55d498af16448e5.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5a8/76f/c0ba96539296e29f10aa802f67.jpg><p>The stunning brunette now boasts more than <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>600,000</a> Instagram followers, with whom she often shares her dazzling selfies and bikini photos. She wants everyone to&nbsp;see a&nbsp;real personality behind the photos that she posts. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a>, “I&nbsp;could link my&nbsp;Instagram to&nbsp;my&nbsp;profile, which would likely help prove that it’s really me&nbsp;but&nbsp;I don’t do&nbsp;it&nbsp;because&nbsp;I think my&nbsp;social media doesn’t present the simple, down-to-earth person I&nbsp;am.”</p><p>She wants to&nbsp;show that she isn’t as&nbsp;glamorous as&nbsp;her Instagram persona suggests. “I’d like to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;connect with someone and then explain my&nbsp;social media to&nbsp;them once they know me&nbsp;a&nbsp;bit more,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a>.</p><p><h2>Joleen is&nbsp;still looking for real love to&nbsp;come into her life.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4bb/463/5ff8335b2a9a43206452477462.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/934/56c/ccf31b51e7a1c01ad8062e63e7.jpg><p>While the woman is&nbsp;often noticed by&nbsp;younger guys on&nbsp;social media and apps, she’s happy to&nbsp;leave the millennial men to&nbsp;her lookalike daughter.</p><p>“Age isn’t a&nbsp;deal-breaker for&nbsp;me, but&nbsp;I don’t want to&nbsp;date a&nbsp;toyboy,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a> in&nbsp;her interview. “I&nbsp;would never even remotely consider dating someone who is&nbsp;young enough to&nbsp;be&nbsp;friends with my&nbsp;daughter.”</p><p>Mature men who are interested in&nbsp;Joleen have to&nbsp;meet the mother’s criteria. “I&nbsp;gravitate toward ambitious, motivated men, someone who is&nbsp;confident, has a&nbsp;positive outlook, and can communicate well,” she said. And the mother-daughter duo isn’t stopping the double dates any time soon&nbsp;— not until they find their second halves.</p><p>What do&nbsp;you think about such an&nbsp;unusual bond between a&nbsp;mom and daughter?
