Johnson has walked a&nbsp;difficult path and pushed hard to&nbsp;reach this point, with his <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> by&nbsp;his side every step of&nbsp;the way. He&nbsp;has always looked to&nbsp;his father as&nbsp;an&nbsp;example for his career in&nbsp;professional wrestling. Still, in&nbsp;their personal lives, they had a&nbsp;rocky connection that they reinforced and improved upon over time until Dwayne’s father’s final moments.</p><p><h2>For most of&nbsp;his childhood, his father was absent.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/feb/6ef/1e4da35cffad019aaca6158027.jpg><p>How we&nbsp;grow up&nbsp;can shape the person we&nbsp;are today. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;kid, <a href=# title="Dwayne Johnson" data-link=tag>Dwayne Johnson</a> had never taken anything for granted but endured difficulties that a&nbsp;child should not experience, like when his family lost their jobs and couldn’t pay rent. It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;trying period for the Johnsons.</p><p>By&nbsp;the time he&nbsp;was&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>13</a>, he&nbsp;had lived in&nbsp;13&nbsp;different states, and by&nbsp;the time he&nbsp;was&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>17</a>, he&nbsp;had encountered several legal issues. Throughout his adolescence, Dwayne Johnson was coached by&nbsp;a&nbsp;team of&nbsp;legendary, rugged wrestlers, including his father, Rocky Johnson.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/88b/e70/18a9e15f7f9fbad91e70cf72ac.jpg><p>“The Rock” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>uncovers</a> the terrible reality of&nbsp;growing up&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;wrestling household in&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;the impact on&nbsp;interpersonal relationships and family dynamics. Rocky, Dwayne’s father, constantly relocated in&nbsp;pursuit of&nbsp;work, whether it&nbsp;be&nbsp;across the nation or&nbsp;only 5&nbsp;miles away.</p><p>Little Dwayne went along with the expectation that they would eventually strike gold and be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;build long-term stability in&nbsp;one of&nbsp;those locations. This, unfortunately, didn’t happen, and it&nbsp;irreversibly shaped his relationship with his father.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/81f/c89/0fe2975af687312665f53f91ad.jpg><p>“My&nbsp;dad was kicked out of&nbsp;his house at&nbsp;13, and he&nbsp;was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>homeless</a>, so&nbsp;that then shaped the man who then raised&nbsp;me,” admitted Dwayne. Rocky, his father, had a&nbsp;hard <a href=# title=childhood data-link=tag>childhood</a> that, in&nbsp;some way, prompted him to&nbsp;raise his child strictly and rigorously. Consequently, Dwayne and his father grew to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;stern and harsh relationship.</p><p><h2>Dwayne admired his father, but their bond was complicated.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3b0/518/d007df56feae09660a2d95f824.jpg><p>As&nbsp;he&nbsp;takes a&nbsp;trip down memory lane, Dwayne has consistently said that this connection with Rocky had been “<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>complex</a>.” His father was a&nbsp;man of&nbsp;definite rules and discipline, as&nbsp;is&nbsp;required while competing in&nbsp;wrestling bouts for a&nbsp;living, but he&nbsp;treated his son with the same coldness and severity that was “motivated by&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>tough love</a>.”</p><p>“My&nbsp;father was a&nbsp;superhero to&nbsp;me,” Dwayne remarked of&nbsp;his late father. “Sometimes, growing up&nbsp;around wrestlers teaches you lessons in&nbsp;exciting ways.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ad0/200/62f2785204aa246d05317daa6f.jpg><p>Growing up, “The Rock” didn’t have many opportunities to&nbsp;make money, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>asked</a> his father to&nbsp;put him through wrestling training. He&nbsp;had looked up&nbsp;to&nbsp;his father, but as&nbsp;their relationship deteriorated over time, he&nbsp;lost that admiration. The actor <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a>, “The irony is&nbsp;I idolized my&nbsp;dad as&nbsp;a&nbsp;boy, and obviously, that idealization started to&nbsp;wane over the years. But the older I&nbsp;got, and the more experienced I&nbsp;got, the more&nbsp;I could appreciate his love for me&nbsp;in&nbsp;that limited capacity.”</p><p><h2>Coping with the grief of&nbsp;losing his dad</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/38c/ed5/3fd7e959e1ac5b1a4915b43fe3.jpg><p>Although the connection became stronger over time, it&nbsp;“would never get <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>easy</a>.” Consequently, Dwayne needed to&nbsp;adjust his viewpoint and rediscover how to&nbsp;love his dad. He&nbsp;knew that they wouldn’t live apart forever just because his old guy hurt him in&nbsp;the past. He&nbsp;forced himself to&nbsp;look for a&nbsp;glimmer of&nbsp;brightness and admit that, despite everything, Rocky was his father and the person who reared him.</p><p>“Some of&nbsp;the things and the lessons that&nbsp;I learned from my&nbsp;old man, I&nbsp;didn’t realize how critical those lessons were until years later,” Dwayne <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d2a/acf/087c915e8fafa9dc880b44c59a.jpg><p>Rocky Johnson passed away on&nbsp;January&nbsp;15, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2020</a>, and it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;bolt from the blue for Dwayne. At&nbsp;the moment of&nbsp;his passing, the father and son were in&nbsp;a&nbsp;conflicting situation, the outcome of&nbsp;an&nbsp;argument they had a&nbsp;while before. “You know, when we&nbsp;lose loved ones like that, we&nbsp;have to&nbsp;go&nbsp;through our own process,” the actor <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explained</a>.</p><p>“But when my&nbsp;dad passed away, you look back, and&nbsp;I know a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;people feel this way too, it’s that wild thing that happens where in&nbsp;life if&nbsp;you have a&nbsp;complicated, loving relationship like&nbsp;I did with my&nbsp;dad, then in&nbsp;death and in&nbsp;passing, in&nbsp;this wild way, you actually become closer.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/467/23d/d755205a10b151aa042666008f.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d53/0ae/ac8b8f52d0bcd02fcef3c0bccf.jpg><p>Vianney Le Caer/Invision/East News</p><p>After their bitter argument, Dwayne Johnson could not say goodbye to&nbsp;his father and didn’t necessarily find solace since then. He&nbsp;would <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>do</a>&nbsp;“everything right now to&nbsp;give him a&nbsp;big ole hug and a&nbsp;big ole kiss before he&nbsp;crossed over and just say thank you, and&nbsp;I love you, and&nbsp;I respect you.”</p><p>Even if&nbsp;Dwayne’s tumultuous connection with Rocky appears harsh and severe, the actor will always treasure the moments he&nbsp;spent with him since it&nbsp;is&nbsp;all he&nbsp;will remember for the rest of&nbsp;his life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLG4rdinnGain527tLvNZqmenpyasLW%2FjKilZqCZqHqku8ypo6KbkamypXnRnqOarJmku7S0yKlksKGknXqptdJmm5qcXam8bsPHqKRmoJViu6bCxKtkrJmZmXqptdJmo5qrpGK0sLvDm7CeZWhmfnaAj2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./airbnb-passive-aggressive.html><span>←</span><span>Airbnb Apologizes For Passive Aggressive San Francisco Ads</span></a>
