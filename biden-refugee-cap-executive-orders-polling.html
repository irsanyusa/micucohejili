That makes the Feb. 4 order the least popular of 28 executive actions tracked by Morning Consult since Inauguration Day by a wide margin.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The finding from the latest survey, conducted Feb. 5-7 among 1,986 registered voters with a margin of error of 2 percentage points, reinforces the notion that immigration will be tricky political territory for the president. Orders pertaining to immigration and immigrant rights constitute five of his seven least popular actions among voters, and are particularly animating for Republicans.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Three in 5 GOP voters “strongly oppose” raising the refugee cap to 125,000 people, roughly the same share who also strongly opposed Biden’s decision to end taxpayer-funded construction of the U.S.-Mexico border wall and the Trump administration’s ban on immigration and travel from several predominantly Muslim countries. Only the administration’s move to include undocumented immigrants residing in the country in the census count drew sharper opposition from Republicans (66 percent).</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The 37 percent of independents who strongly oppose raising the refugee cap is also this group’s highest level of dissent against the orders tracked so far, followed by Biden’s move to pause the Trump administration’s “Remain in Mexico” policy for asylum seekers (33 percent).</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Nor does the move to allow more refugees into the country resonate particularly deeply with the president’s own base. While 61 percent of Democratic voters support the expansion -- and 33 percent “strongly support” it -- that share places the executive order at the bottom of the list as well.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">In a Punchbowl News interview published Tuesday, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) cited immigration as one of three areas of focus (along with American workers and “fighting back against socialism”) for the upcoming 2022 midterm elections cycle. The public’s reception to Biden’s moves on immigration suggests the topic is among the most politically potent and expedient targets for the GOP, which is looking to regain majorities in the House and Senate next year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6zwMico56rX5e2pbHNZqmenqWcsqZ5wpqnZp2omrC2wMivnGanopmys7%2BMqaalpJmjtA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ultimate-scottish-quiz.html><span>←</span><span>Ultimate Scottish quiz | Scotland.org</span></a>
