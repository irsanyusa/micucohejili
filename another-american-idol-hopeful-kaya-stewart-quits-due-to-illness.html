However, things took a turn for the worse when she woke up feeling unwell the next day.</p><p>Despite wanting to continue on with the show, Stewart ultimately decided not to perform, citing a desire to give a hundred percent and not give an unfair representation of herself or Wilmore. She tearfully announced her departure from the competition, leaving both her duet partner and judge Katy Perry in tears as well.</p><p>“I got sick at the beginning of Hollywood Week and I have been trying to push myself and keep going.” Stewart said. “I’ve decided to not perform but Fire is going to perform and I’m really grateful that I got to be here and thank you guys but I’m not going to be performing.”</p><p>Stewart’s departure will undoubtedly disappoint her fans, but the young artist has already demonstrated immense talent and promise in her brief time on the show. We wish her the best of luck in her future endeavors and look forward to hearing more from her in the years to come.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8anQum62AAI&t=205s</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Kaya Stewart is The Second Consecutive Dropout This Season</h2><p><a href=# class=broken_link>American Idol</a> suffered another blow as Stewart became the second consecutive contestant to drop out of the show. Stewart had received glowing praise during her audition, where she performed a song she co-wrote with her father.</p><p>The exit of Stewart comes after <a href=#>Sara Beth Liebe</a> had opted to quit the show the night before. During Sunday’s episode, Liebe had expressed her desire to leave the competition to guest vocal coach Clay Aiken, who was a runner-up on Season two of American Idol.</p><p>Liebe had faced criticism from viewers for being “mom-shamed” by judge Perry during her initial audition. Perry had joked that Liebe had been “laying on the table too much” after having her first child at 18 years old. Despite Perry’s attempts to convince Liebe to stay in the competition, she ultimately decided to leave.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Original_NeilSalsich_BlakeShelton-220x147.jpg alt="Blake Shelton Takes a Dig at Adam Levine as ‘The Voice’ Contestant Drops Out" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKemraCVp3qiucSroJyZnmK2pbvLZp%2BoqJWbwq15ypqwmmWjqbK4rdGtZKqtmanAbrDUnmStp12eua26xKyqaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./10-emerging-spanish-producers-1236097650.html><span>←</span><span>10 Emerging Spanish Producers to Watch</span></a>
