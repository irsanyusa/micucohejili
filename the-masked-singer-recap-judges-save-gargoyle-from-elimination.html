The panel was impressed, and Nicole Scherzinger even hinted that she might have a crush. Guesses from the panel about Gargoyle’s identity included Antonio Gates, Odell Beckham Jr., and Mario.</p><p>At the end of the night, Gargoyle competed in the Battle Royale against Squirrel. They both performed “Kryptonite” by Three Doors Down in different styles. After the panel voted, Squirrel earned enough votes to move on to next week’s show.</p><p>That meant Gargoyle had to be unmasked. However, panelist Jenny McCarthy ended up hitting the “Ding Dong, Keep It On” Bell to keep them in the competition. This is the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">second week in a row</a> that the panel has used the bell.</p><p>Gargoyle now has the opportunity to rejoin the competition. However, they’ll have to go up against the season’s other bell recipients, including Medusa, to earn the coveted spot.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WHO IS THE GARGOYLE? ‘THE MASKED SINGER’ PREDICTIONS & CLUES!</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-wolf-unmasked-as-singer-michael-bolton>Wolf Unmasked as Singer Michael Bolton</h3><p>There was only one unmasking during Wednesday’s episode. After performing “Break on Through” by the Doors, Wolf failed to receive enough votes to move on in the competition. While Ken Jeong guessed that it was Richard Marx, the other three panelists were correct in guessing it was Michael Bolton.</p><p>Next week, Squirrel will go up against two new competitors for a chance to stay in the competition. They showed off a great voice, performing “Try” by Pink. Guesses from the panel about Squirrel’s identity included Katie Holmes, Margot Robbie, and Uma Thurman.</p><p>Do you think the panel made the right decision saving Gargoyle this week?
