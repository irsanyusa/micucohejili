I&nbsp;mean, technically, everyone can be&nbsp;a&nbsp;washing machine when they wash clothes, but this device washes you. The Japanese tech company recently declared that they have plans to&nbsp;produce a&nbsp;washing machine for humans. Just imagine the spin cycle&nbsp;— yikes! It&nbsp;turns out that this idea dates back to&nbsp;the 1970 Osaka Expo. Back then it&nbsp;featured a&nbsp;device named ‘Ultrasonic Bath’ by&nbsp;another company. This machine was designed to&nbsp;massage and dry a&nbsp;person in&nbsp;a&nbsp;15-minute cycle. It&nbsp;remained a&nbsp;concept at&nbsp;that time, but now another company aims to&nbsp;turn it&nbsp;into a&nbsp;thing.</p><p>They want to&nbsp;release a&nbsp;commercial product in&nbsp;2025. This product will clean the body of&nbsp;the user. It&nbsp;has other features too. For instance, it’ll be&nbsp;a&nbsp;healing space where the user can relax with music and images inside the machine. Sensors will examine the condition of&nbsp;sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves, and&nbsp;AI will use this data to&nbsp;create the ultimate comfort zone for the user. Would you buy that device?</p><p>Let’s stay in&nbsp;Japan for a&nbsp;little longer and take a&nbsp;look at&nbsp;these sleeping pods at&nbsp;Japan Railway Stations. The capsules are designed for people who want to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;nap or&nbsp;work. It’s hard to&nbsp;lie down on&nbsp;regular seats at&nbsp;the station, and there’s always a&nbsp;risk that someone could grab your stuff if&nbsp;you fall asleep. For $23, you can have your own small space for 2&nbsp;hours. What do&nbsp;you get? A&nbsp;reclining chair, a&nbsp;table, power outlets, and a&nbsp;coffee machine.</p><p>The place has a&nbsp;lock, and it’s soundproof, which is&nbsp;great considering you’re in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;a&nbsp;busy station. Hand sanitizer, and fans are also available at&nbsp;the pod. If&nbsp;you’re traveling with other people, you have another option to&nbsp;choose from. A&nbsp;different cabinet offers a&nbsp;place for up&nbsp;to&nbsp;4&nbsp;people. It&nbsp;has two sets of&nbsp;couches, a&nbsp;table in&nbsp;the middle, and a&nbsp;monitor on&nbsp;the wall.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/fc3/3f9/21bbab59bcb8f2899d51c75fa1.png><p>Moving on&nbsp;to&nbsp;the oceans. We&nbsp;know that coral reefs are a&nbsp;crucial part of&nbsp;ocean ecosystems, and they’re in&nbsp;danger. To&nbsp;keep the remaining reefs and restore them, conservationists are using 3D&nbsp;printers to&nbsp;make artificial reefs. They begin by&nbsp;examining the reef to&nbsp;understand its characteristics. They do&nbsp;this to&nbsp;replicate the reef as&nbsp;accurately as&nbsp;possible.</p><p>Then they print the reefs using a&nbsp;certain type of&nbsp;clay. 3D&nbsp;printers generally use types of&nbsp;plastic, but obviously, plastic wouldn’t work replicating coral reefs. This is&nbsp;cool and beneficial, considering that reefs make up&nbsp;to&nbsp;1% of&nbsp;the Earth’s surface. Yet they’re the ones to&nbsp;maintain the highest level of&nbsp;marine diversity in&nbsp;the world.</p><p>This one is&nbsp;a&nbsp;VR system that moves your body for you. This invention could change the way people experience&nbsp;VR and AR. Researchers put pads onto the person’s neck muscles They use electrical muscle stimulation to&nbsp;take control of&nbsp;the person’s body and move&nbsp;it. Not the full control, though. The player won’t turn into a&nbsp;puppet controlled by&nbsp;the researchers.</p><p>For instance, in&nbsp;a&nbsp;fire safety demonstration, the pads were used to&nbsp;lead the player’s eye-line toward the location of&nbsp;the live fire. The technology acknowledges the player’s movements in&nbsp;real-time. It&nbsp;only initiates an&nbsp;involuntary move when the player does not activate their muscles. This means that there’s no&nbsp;injury risk from a&nbsp;triggered motion. It&nbsp;feels like the “future technology” is&nbsp;here to&nbsp;stay.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/e31/b22/b29d3058ea91cca601b24af717.png><p>Let’s assume you’re driving and opened to&nbsp;the map from your phone to&nbsp;get to&nbsp;your destination. You might easily get distracted while driving. New systems can solve this problem. Eyelights is&nbsp;an&nbsp;example of&nbsp;this system. It’s a&nbsp;concept technology that operates a&nbsp;holograph. You would look at&nbsp;a&nbsp;real screen to&nbsp;display info like maps or&nbsp;vital stats of&nbsp;the vehicle. With this system, you can look at&nbsp;the road since the holograph is&nbsp;also on&nbsp;the windshield. You can wave your hand to&nbsp;control the system. Goodbye to&nbsp;touch interfaces.</p><p>Vacuum cleaner robots and other technologies to&nbsp;tidy our houses are on&nbsp;the rise. But what about the cleanliness of&nbsp;the places out of&nbsp;sight, like your bed? Let me&nbsp;introduce you to&nbsp;this bot. This small cleaning robot disinfects the surface with&nbsp;UV lights. It&nbsp;sanitizes your bed from all the germs you don’t want to&nbsp;live with. Plus, it&nbsp;weighs less than half a&nbsp;pound. You can take it&nbsp;with you when you -let’s say- go&nbsp;away and stay at&nbsp;a&nbsp;hotel.</p><p>According to&nbsp;a&nbsp;study, a&nbsp;pillowcase and sheets used for a&nbsp;week contain 3&nbsp;to&nbsp;5&nbsp;million microbial cells per square inch. By&nbsp;the fourth week, this number reaches almost 12&nbsp;million. So, buying one of&nbsp;these products can be&nbsp;considerable. But really guy, you should change your bed more often than once a&nbsp;month. Ew!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/7b9/147/e230e7548ab26a393ae8ed4245.png><p>The next one is&nbsp;a&nbsp;joystick-controlled robotic surgeon. When someone has a&nbsp;<a href=# title=stroke data-link=tag>stroke</a> or&nbsp;aneurysm, they should be&nbsp;seen by&nbsp;a&nbsp;doctor in&nbsp;a&nbsp;“golden hour.” Then the damage can be&nbsp;treated without lasting consequences. Yet, few doctors are specialized in&nbsp;this field.</p><p>It&nbsp;takes years to&nbsp;become proficient in&nbsp;these operations. These expert doctors are mostly in&nbsp;big cities. Engineers at&nbsp;MIT have noticed this and developed a&nbsp;telerobotic surgical system. The system has a&nbsp;modified joystick. Surgeons can use it&nbsp;and conduct operations remotely. What they had in&nbsp;mind was to&nbsp;set up&nbsp;this system at&nbsp;hospitals around the country and the world. In&nbsp;that way, trained surgeons can perform surgeries from far away.</p><p>Have you ever driven on&nbsp;solar roadways? The name is&nbsp;pretty self-explanatory. Engineers pave roads or&nbsp;sidewalks with solar wafers. They’re protected under thick layers of&nbsp;strong, special glass. These panels are used to&nbsp;generate electricity from the surface. These panels have even more advantages. They can gather heat to&nbsp;melt the snow in&nbsp;the winter. They can also be&nbsp;programmed electronically to&nbsp;display intended markings on&nbsp;the road.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/6c2/ab0/e660bd563ca8390c083e3c0c5d.png><p>Banana-peeling robot. You might think this is&nbsp;a&nbsp;waste of&nbsp;time and money for researchers to&nbsp;spend. It’s easy to&nbsp;peel a&nbsp;banana, right? But for robots, this is&nbsp;actually a&nbsp;challenging task because it&nbsp;requires finesse and spatial awareness. Bananas come in&nbsp;assorted sizes and shapes.</p><p>Since there’s no&nbsp;fixed product, robots can’t repeat the same motion to&nbsp;all bananas repeatedly. Scientists use&nbsp;AI deep learning so&nbsp;that robots can mimic human movements. People know where the banana is&nbsp;and where to&nbsp;grasp&nbsp;it. A&nbsp;robot needs to&nbsp;learn these. So&nbsp;far, robots are 50&nbsp;percent successful in&nbsp;doing so&nbsp;despite their advanced machine learning.</p><p>Flying vehicles used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;no&nbsp;more than futuristic dreams. Not anymore. SkyDrive is&nbsp;making a&nbsp;prototype. It’ll be&nbsp;quiet, compact &&nbsp;emission-free. They aimed to&nbsp;introduce it&nbsp;as&nbsp;an&nbsp;air-taxi soon. It&nbsp;can carry up&nbsp;to&nbsp;1,100 pounds at&nbsp;62&nbsp;miles per hour. This would change our lives in&nbsp;dealing from health emergencies to&nbsp;deliveries of&nbsp;products and people.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/a7e/e1f/e2ceb25484baee0e263332693a.png><p>Finding clean water can be&nbsp;a&nbsp;grueling task when you’re in&nbsp;a&nbsp;deserted place. Handheld filters got your back now. LifeStraw, for instance, allows you to&nbsp;get water from a&nbsp;running stream without worrying about impurities. Geopress is&nbsp;another product that has a&nbsp;special filter. It&nbsp;removes harmful heavy metals, bacteria, and other stuff.</p><p>Researchers developed “the first living robots,” as&nbsp;they declared. These robots are called Xenobots. They are made from the stem cells of&nbsp;a&nbsp;frog heart and frog skin. These robots are super tiny&nbsp;— like smaller than half an&nbsp;inch.</p><p>Sometimes engineers work on&nbsp;cute and less groundbreaking stuff too. This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;model of&nbsp;a&nbsp;cat robot. It&nbsp;can nibble on&nbsp;the user’s fingertip. The idea is&nbsp;to&nbsp;lighten the user’s mood with this pleasing sensation. Amagami Ham Ham -this is&nbsp;the name of&nbsp;the stuffed robot- has an&nbsp;algorithm called a&nbsp;“Hamgorithm.”</p><p>It&nbsp;has various nibbling patterns, and the devices pick it&nbsp;randomly for you. It’ll be&nbsp;a&nbsp;surprise for you. You might feel a&nbsp;tasting nibble or&nbsp;a&nbsp;massaging nibble. Hey, as&nbsp;long as&nbsp;the robot cat has no&nbsp;cat teeth, I’m okay with the nibbling thing. Feel free to&nbsp;let me&nbsp;know about other cool tech inventions! Bye.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGpsYyhrKaZnmLEor%2FHoqWgZZ2WsKm1zZ5kraCRqXq4tculZJqko6R6uK3SoWSyp6Wneq61zZ1kcWlla4V2ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chris-brown-singer-claims-karrueche-tran-went-on-date-nights-with-drake.html><span>←</span><span>Singer claims Karrueche Tran went on date nights with Drake!</span></a>
