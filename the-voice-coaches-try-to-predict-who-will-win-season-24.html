Reba McEntire also talked about joining the show after Blake Shelton’s exit.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-voice-coaches-speculate-about-season-24>The Voice Coaches Speculate About Season 24</h2><p>When asked to predict which coach will win Season 24 (without choosing themselves), the coaches had some interesting answers. John Legend mentioned how many country fans watch the show, adding that this could work out in McEntire’s favor.</p><p>Gwen Stefani agreed, saying of McEntire, “I didn’t realize in the Blinds that she had that many good people on her team.” However, Niall Horan pointed out that everyone thought Shelton would win his last season on the show, but he didn’t. He called Legend’s team this season “crazy.”</p><p>McEntire admitted that there’s really no way to predict what will happen, saying, “As I have found out, it doesn’t matter about the Blind Auditions. It doesn’t matter about the Battle rounds, Knockout rounds. It’s a crapshoot. Anybody could win.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">REBA MCENTIRE STEALS THE SHOW FROM FELLOW COACHES IN NEWEST ‘THE VOICE’ PROMO</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-mcentire-says-fellow-coaches-are-giving-her-tips>McEntire Says Fellow Coaches Are Giving Her Tips</h2><p>When asked how much confidence she has coming onto the show as a new coach, McEntire responded, “Absolutely none.” She added of her fellow coaches, “They’re being so sweet, teaching me, guiding me. I couldn’t do it without them.”</p><p>The country star went on to say that she’s trying to do Shelton proud as she fills his seat. The longtime coach left the show earlier this year after 23 seasons and nine wins. Shelton’s wife Gwen Stefani is returning to the show this season for the first time without him.</p><p>“It’s really different being on the show without him,” Stefani admitted. “I miss him so bad on the show. But at the same time, it hasn’t been as hard as I thought it was gonna be, ’cause I think he was just so ready to have a break that it was kind of weighing on me the last season we were on there.”</p><p>The Voice Season 24 premieres Monday, September 25, at 8/7c on NBC.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Original_NickCannon_Michael-Becker_FOX-220x147.jpg alt="Nick Cannon Credits His Early Success to Jamie Foxx, Will Smith" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZq6fnrCmecKomJyglah6tb7YZquoZaCnsqW1wq1ksKCfYsSquMtmrqKmXaiyor%2FOp2RrbF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dans-les-coulisses-de-la-dune-du-pilat33-un-outil-de-sensibilisation-evolutif.html><span>←</span><span>un outil de sensibilisation volutif</span></a>
