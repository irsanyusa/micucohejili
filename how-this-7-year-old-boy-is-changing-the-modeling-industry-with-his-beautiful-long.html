In fact, even when I had a scan done when I was pregnant, at about six months, you could literally see it floating around in the womb."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Farouk was signed with a model agency since the age of six months. "I think the hair was at a reasonable length then for him to be a boy with hair," she said. "It was like the clich bold-style afro."</p><p>"Because it wasn't really accepted, especially at that time, for boys to have long hair."</p><p>As his hair grew longer and longer, Bonnie was pressured to get Farouk a haircut as the only way to him on the scene, but she never gave up, and in a few years Farouk's hair became sought-after in the industry.</p><p>"Nowadays, people are trying to get that sort of length hair. It's really cool that the fashion companies want that look. They want that androgynous look to be a little bit different."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p7y6Kdnqukrrmme8eormasmJ7AboOMspyaql2kuaV5waiwZqGjYrCprc2goKefXam1pnnMqJuepJmjtG61zZ2srKyirnq4tdOhZKGho2Kvpq3UraCfrZxiubC6xmitnW6eZ7p3</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./heather-parry-fired-live-nation-productions-1203112172.html><span>←</span><span>Heather Parry Fired From Live Nation Productions</span></a>
