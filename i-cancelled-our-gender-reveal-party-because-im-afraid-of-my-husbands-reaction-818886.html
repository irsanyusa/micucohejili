My&nbsp;husband and&nbsp;I have already booked the venue for the <a href=# title=gender data-link=tag>gender</a> reveal, will lose the photographer’s deposit, and what we&nbsp;spent on&nbsp;decorations, etc.</p><p>However, he&nbsp;is&nbsp;more concerned about the reputation effect as&nbsp;he&nbsp;grew up&nbsp;affluent, has a&nbsp;very high-paying job, and also has a&nbsp;stake in&nbsp;a&nbsp;family business.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a81/38a/5c00125aa899da09eb24517a7a.jpg><p>I think, I can never earn over which I paid by my precedent employer, but I was wrong, world is so large to try their fate. but now I am making $52/h even more,and easily earn minimum $1300/week, on the experience everyone must try to do work online, easy way to earn, here's an example.</p><p>𝐰𝐰𝐰.Richnow05</p><p>However, I&nbsp;can tell that despite&nbsp;us already having a&nbsp;boy who he&nbsp;absolutely adores (they can do&nbsp;no&nbsp;wrong in&nbsp;each other’s eyes, my&nbsp;son always had every toy, fun activity, and best clothes gifted by&nbsp;his dad), he&nbsp;desperately wants our second child (who we&nbsp;expect to&nbsp;be&nbsp;our last) to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;boy.</p><p>I&nbsp;went into planning this reveal rationalizing that gender disappointment is&nbsp;okay, but I’ve come to&nbsp;realize that there is&nbsp;wishing you’re having a&nbsp;son and then there’s fixating on&nbsp;NOT having a&nbsp;daughter even more than wanting another son, and my&nbsp;husband falls into the second category.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/06c/c9c/d8db0f5ea4b7472035ad1ba395.jpg><p>We&nbsp;didn’t do&nbsp;a&nbsp;gender reveal for our firstborn because my&nbsp;husband kept putting off whether or&nbsp;not he&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;hear it&nbsp;from the doctor and when. We&nbsp;ended up&nbsp;learning (with him ecstatic) about having a&nbsp;son less than a&nbsp;month before giving birth.</p><p>It’s not all his fault: he&nbsp;grew up&nbsp;with an&nbsp;older dad who was always controlling towards his mother. Their town at&nbsp;the time was essentially a&nbsp;company town, and his dad threatened her family’s jobs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/367/24c/440ece5ced9786b018e2c98164.jpg><p>Now his demons are back. We&nbsp;got to&nbsp;a&nbsp;point where he&nbsp;said fine to&nbsp;me&nbsp;going alone to&nbsp;hear the baby’s gender (without telling him), and&nbsp;I found out we&nbsp;were having a&nbsp;girl. I&nbsp;guess&nbsp;I didn’t have a&nbsp;good poker face of&nbsp;his negative reaction after&nbsp;I got home.</p><p>He&nbsp;is&nbsp;arguing he&nbsp;doesn’t know the baby’s gender because&nbsp;I did not explicitly tell him, but 100 percent he&nbsp;does know. I’d be&nbsp;fine with a&nbsp;reveal where the guests are the ones being surprised, but it’s in&nbsp;a&nbsp;week and with each day my&nbsp;husband grows more withdrawn, and he’s not the type who can fake happiness and often tries to&nbsp;leave and pull me&nbsp;away with him when he’s really upset.</p><p>I&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;pull the plug. Again, he’s not mad about the money, yet he’s angry that we’re doing this to&nbsp;our family and friends and what this may say about him. I&nbsp;put my&nbsp;foot down.</p><p><h2>People were concerned about her.</h2></p><ul><li>“I&nbsp;feel sorry for you that you thought marrying him was a&nbsp;good idea, you need to&nbsp;work on&nbsp;your self-esteem.
