I knew before I read it that arcades were important to me: We never had a game console in the house when I was a kid, so until recently, at least, the majority of game-playing I’d ever done took place in arcades, one quarter at a time. (Mostly at 1001 Plays, an arcade on Massachusetts Avenue in Cambridge, Mass. — if you’re about my age and grew up in Boston, you went there, too.)</p><p>What I didn’t realize until I read June’s piece is that arcades weren’t just about the games. They were about independence — being with other kids, away from adults in a place grownups approved of only grudgingly, if at all. (Googling for “1001 Plays,” I just learned that the City of Boston <a title href=#>fought strenuously</a> to prevent it from opening a branch in Boston, on the grounds that arcades were dangerous, overcrowded and generally undesirable.) In a strange way, playing Popeye at an arcade was a proving ground for adulthood.</p><p><span>Thanks to the amazing emulator known as <a title href=#>MAME</a> and a jailbroken iPad, I can play most of the games I loved 30 years ago at home. And </span>the only times in recent years when I’ve been inside something that qualifies as an old-school arcade is when I’ve played miniature golf. (Mini-golf courses, bless ’em, generally have extremely classic arcades on the premises.) June’s article leaves me sorry for myself for having lost the arcades of my youth — and sorry for today’s kids for never having experienced arcade life in the first place.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmislZi1ra3NnWWtoZ2ae6S7zGhpaWljZH1ye5BvZq2glWLBs63Goppmr5%2BnuaV5wqGYp5%2BZo7RuuM6sqmanlmLBqbGMoKmemaRirq6x0aKamqZdlr%2BkrcOeZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./872-own-goal-crouch.html><span>←</span><span>Own goal for Crouch | YouGov</span></a>
