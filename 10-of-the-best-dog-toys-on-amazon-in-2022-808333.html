My&nbsp;Staffie has played with it&nbsp;every day since&nbsp;I purchased&nbsp;it, and it&nbsp;shows very little signs of&nbsp;wear! Bearing in&nbsp;mind that my&nbsp;<strong>dog</strong> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;Staffie, known to&nbsp;have extremely strong jaws, this toy seems unchewable! It’s his favorite toy, and he&nbsp;loves to&nbsp;show it&nbsp;off to&nbsp;friends and family.<br>The shape is&nbsp;perfect for carrying in&nbsp;his mouth, which he&nbsp;does quite a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;the time. This is&nbsp;by&nbsp;far the <strong>best chew toy</strong>&nbsp;I have bought for my&nbsp;dog, and although he&nbsp;does occasionally play with his other toys, this is&nbsp;his favorite. I’m certain he&nbsp;would be&nbsp;very unhappy if&nbsp;it&nbsp;went missing at&nbsp;any time. I&nbsp;can wholeheartedly recommend this toy. A&nbsp;great product and at&nbsp;an&nbsp;excellent price. If&nbsp;my&nbsp;<strong>dog</strong> is&nbsp;happy, then so&nbsp;am&nbsp;I. —&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Ms&nbsp;Jolly</a></li></ul><p><h2>2.

It’s durable, and you can use it&nbsp;to&nbsp;play many different games with your <strong>dog</strong>. It&nbsp;will keep them interested longer than usual toys&nbsp;do.</p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>One of&nbsp;the best dog toys I’ve ever bought&nbsp;</strong>— my&nbsp;<strong>dogs</strong> absolutely love this ball. It’s very robust and has stood up&nbsp;to&nbsp;2&nbsp;energetic Border Collies chewing it&nbsp;and pouncing on&nbsp;it. All of&nbsp;the little handles make it&nbsp;great as&nbsp;a&nbsp;tug toy for both of&nbsp;them to&nbsp;play together. I’m so&nbsp;impressed that&nbsp;I bought another one, but so&nbsp;far&nbsp;I haven’t needed to&nbsp;blow it&nbsp;up&nbsp;because the first one is&nbsp;still in&nbsp;great shape. —&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Dawn</a></li></ul><p><h2>3.

The head has a&nbsp;squeaker in&nbsp;it, which will catch your dog’s attention fast and keep them entertained for longer.</p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>My&nbsp;dog loves&nbsp;it, worth the money</strong>&nbsp;— my&nbsp;3-year-old French bulldog can not get enough of&nbsp;this toy. She’s been inseparable from it&nbsp;since&nbsp;I got it&nbsp;for her. She’s quite a&nbsp;chewer too, and it&nbsp;seems to&nbsp;be&nbsp;holding up&nbsp;pretty well. It&nbsp;has no&nbsp;stuffing in&nbsp;it, which is&nbsp;really nice. At&nbsp;least if&nbsp;it&nbsp;does end up&nbsp;ripping, I&nbsp;know my&nbsp;<strong>dog</strong> won’t choke on&nbsp;anything. If&nbsp;she does end up&nbsp;chewing through it&nbsp;at&nbsp;some point, I’ll probably order another one as&nbsp;it’s worth the money, since she loves it&nbsp;that much. —&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>sandra</a></li></ul><p><h2>4.

Plus, playtime will become even more fun once you add treats inside the toy.</p><p><strong>Promising reviews:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>My&nbsp;puppy loves it</strong>&nbsp;— my&nbsp;German Shepherd <strong>puppy </strong>loves this toy. It&nbsp;keeps her occupied for a&nbsp;while, and even when she’s managed to&nbsp;get all the treats out, she enjoys running around and playing with&nbsp;it. Very durable so&nbsp;far. —&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Hannah Felton</a></li><li><strong>Great for hyperactive puppies</strong>&nbsp;— brilliant toy. My&nbsp;<strong>puppy</strong> plays for hours with this. —&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Georgina Coles</a></li></ul><p><h2>5.

For example, this cactus toy will make it&nbsp;easier for your <strong>dog </strong>to&nbsp;chew&nbsp;on. Plus, the design is&nbsp;great for puppies who are <strong>teething</strong>, taking their attention away from your shoes and other household items.</p><p><strong>Promising reviews:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Definitely his favorite</strong>&nbsp;— this is&nbsp;the first chew toy we&nbsp;have come across that is&nbsp;so&nbsp;strong and durable. It’s made of&nbsp;very thick material and has a&nbsp;great squeaker! Also, it’s great with peanut butter, he&nbsp;loves&nbsp;it! —&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Rex Toes</a></li><li><strong>Amazingly tough chew toy</strong>&nbsp;— well, having a&nbsp;beagle isn’t easy, as&nbsp;his number one thing to&nbsp;do&nbsp;is&nbsp;destroy things! As&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;this toy arrived, I&nbsp;could feel it&nbsp;would stand the test of&nbsp;time. He&nbsp;loves&nbsp;it. The squeaker, which confuses him for a&nbsp;second, makes playtime even more fun. All in&nbsp;all, a&nbsp;very <strong>good</strong> product! —&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Amazon Customer</a></li></ul><p><h2>6. A&nbsp;simple ball for playing fetch with your dog</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b15/d39/a967d5577cb7772f4a752bf5e8.jpg><p><strong>Buy the ball on&nbsp;Amazon </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>Medium size</p><p>Sometimes, simple things are the <strong>best</strong>, and the same goes for this ball. Even though the toy is&nbsp;empty inside, the rubber is&nbsp;so&nbsp;tough that your <strong>dog</strong> won’t be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;destroy it&nbsp;very easily.</p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>My&nbsp;Tyson’s favorite toy!</strong> These are just brilliant! I&nbsp;was slightly skeptical at&nbsp;first, if&nbsp;I’m totally honest, about them being hollow, but that really isn’t an&nbsp;issue at&nbsp;all, as&nbsp;they must be&nbsp;super strong! And I&nbsp;have a&nbsp;Staffy! He&nbsp;absolutely loves destroying balls and goes through tennis balls in&nbsp;a&nbsp;few seconds, so&nbsp;I had to&nbsp;resort to&nbsp;the solid rubber balls and take them away from him at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;each walk. He&nbsp;still manages to&nbsp;gnaw off chunks of&nbsp;them, and luckily spits them out instead of&nbsp;swallowing them.<br>So, after Chuck It&nbsp;Ultra Balls were recommended to&nbsp;me, I&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;give them a&nbsp;go&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;birthday present for my&nbsp;Tyson. He&nbsp;loves them and sits chewing on&nbsp;them for ages, squishing them in&nbsp;his mouth constantly! They are made from strong, natural, durable rubber, and in&nbsp;the case of&nbsp;my&nbsp;dog, I&nbsp;would highly recommend them as&nbsp;being Staffy proof. I’m very happy with these. —&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Tina</a></li></ul><p><h2>7.

These interactive training buttons will help you train your <strong>dog</strong> faster while having some fun at&nbsp;the same time.</p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Works brilliantly</strong>&nbsp;— it&nbsp;only took 7&nbsp;minutes for our puppy to&nbsp;learn to&nbsp;press the button for a&nbsp;treat (a&nbsp;bit longer for our older dog). While a&nbsp;nice trick, it’s not practical for the puppy to&nbsp;have access to&nbsp;the button all day long, as&nbsp;she would quite happily keep pressing it&nbsp;for treats.<br>It&nbsp;was good to&nbsp;teach the phrase “press the button,” which laid the foundation for using the buttons for other tricks and tasks. —&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Mike</a></li></ul><p><h2>8.

Because it&nbsp;has a&nbsp;very intimidating squeak, your pet will love to&nbsp;play with it&nbsp;and always keep it&nbsp;by&nbsp;its side.</p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>It’s my&nbsp;retired Greyhound’s best friend. </strong>I&nbsp;adopted my&nbsp;boy less than a&nbsp;week ago, and he&nbsp;had never had <strong>toys</strong> before, and out of&nbsp;all of&nbsp;the <strong>toys</strong>&nbsp;I bought him, he&nbsp;was only interested in&nbsp;the duck! I&nbsp;think because it&nbsp;looks like prey that Percy likes playing with him. I&nbsp;would recommend it&nbsp;for other retired greyhounds who may not be&nbsp;used to&nbsp;<strong>toys</strong>! —&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Amyfrances</a></li></ul><p><h2>9. A&nbsp;durable ramen <strong>dog</strong> toy that’s great for hiding treats</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/21e/0f3/2b3ca45db5be2b1aee1d86fc39.jpg><p><strong>Buy the ramen toy on&nbsp;Amazon </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>This is&nbsp;one really <strong>interesting</strong> toy idea, not only<strong> </strong>because it&nbsp;represents a&nbsp;really tasty dish, but also because it&nbsp;will mentally and physically stimulate your pet. You can also put some treats in&nbsp;the little pockets that are connected with the noodles, making playtime even more proactive.</p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>It&nbsp;keeps my&nbsp;dog busy.</strong> It’s a&nbsp;brilliant toy, very creative design. My&nbsp;<strong>dog</strong> loves playing “find&nbsp;it,” and when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;<strong>toys</strong>, she generally only likes those that are soft and squeaky. This one doesn’t actually squeak but crinkles, yet she loves&nbsp;it!<br>It&nbsp;took her a&nbsp;while to&nbsp;get it&nbsp;open the first time (simple, yet very clever velcro closure that sticks to&nbsp;the red soft material), but now she has mastered&nbsp;it. She tears out the innards, looking for the hidden treasure! She’s bright and fussy and not a&nbsp;lot holds her interest, but this toy is&nbsp;a&nbsp;hit<strong>.</strong><br>My&nbsp;<strong>dog</strong> needs more of&nbsp;a&nbsp;challenge, so&nbsp;the noodle cup suits her better. So&nbsp;far, it’s held up&nbsp;perfectly to&nbsp;foraging and light tug and fetch games without damage. My&nbsp;<strong>dog </strong>is&nbsp;small and a&nbsp;fairly gentle chewer, though. —&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Amazon Customer</a></li></ul><p><h2>10. <strong>Puppy</strong> plush <strong>toys</strong> to&nbsp;keep your <strong>dog </strong>interested longer (10&nbsp;pieces)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fde/2ab/3ea7cf57749e3b0ffcf1b10464.jpg><p><strong>Buy one of&nbsp;the sets on&nbsp;Amazon </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>High-quality plush</p><p>It&nbsp;seems like it’s never enough when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;<strong>dog toys</strong>, especially if&nbsp;your <strong>dog</strong> enjoys them or&nbsp;tears them apart fast. This set of&nbsp;plush <strong>toys</strong> will be&nbsp;a&nbsp;game-changer because you’ll get so&nbsp;many <strong>toys</strong> for an&nbsp;amazing price. The plushies are great for small and medium-sized <strong>dogs</strong>.</p><p><strong>Promising review:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Puppy proof!</strong> My&nbsp;new <strong>puppy </strong>was chewing everything he&nbsp;could get his teeth into. I&nbsp;took a&nbsp;risk and purchased these for him. They have been excellent. They are small but have lasted for ages and are chewed daily. I&nbsp;thought for the price they would only last a&nbsp;short while, but&nbsp;no, he&nbsp;loves them and chews them all the time. I&nbsp;have to&nbsp;add that my&nbsp;<strong>dog</strong> is&nbsp;small-medium in&nbsp;size.<br>Money well spent, and&nbsp;I have spent some on&nbsp;various <strong>toys</strong>. I&nbsp;often stuff one of&nbsp;these into a&nbsp;Ho-Lee roller dog ball, and it&nbsp;keeps him busy for ages. —&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>JB&nbsp;Sussex</a></li></ul><p>What breed of&nbsp;dog do&nbsp;you have?
