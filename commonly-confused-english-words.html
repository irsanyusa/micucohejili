Advise vs. Advice</h2><p>“Advise” and “advice” are frequently confused because their spelling is so similar—after all, “s” and “c” can often make the same sound. However, these words are actually pronounced differently and one can’t be used in the place of the other.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Advise (verb)</h3><p><strong>Meaning:</strong> To give a suggestion</p><p><strong>Pronunciation: </strong>ad-VIZE</p><p><strong>Example: </strong>“I feel like I’m always making bad decisions. I’d love to speak to someone who could advise me on how to live my life!”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Advice (noun)</h3><p><strong>Meaning:</strong> An opinion or suggestion</p><p><strong>Pronunciation:</strong> ad-VICE</p><p><strong>Example: </strong>“I took your advice and asked my boss for a raise. She agreed!”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=2.-Affect-vs.-Effect>2. Affect vs. Effect</h2><p>These words are very commonly mixed up; sometimes they’re even pronounced the same way. But they’re not interchangeable, so make sure you know which is which.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Affect (verb)</h3><p><strong>Meaning:</strong> To cause something to change</p><p><strong>Pronunciation: </strong>uh-FEKT</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> “If you work all the time and never take time to relax, it will affect your mental health.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Effect (noun)</h3><p><strong>Meaning:</strong> The change that happens to something as the result of an action</p><p><strong>Pronunciation:</strong> ee-FEKT/uh-FEKT</p><p><strong>Example: </strong>“Inflation has had a major effect on the price of everything from gas to groceries.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=3.-Breath-vs.-Breathe>3. Breath vs. Breathe</h2><p>With the addition of just one letter, the pronunciation of “breathe” becomes quite different from “breath.”&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Breath (noun)</h3><p><strong>Meaning: </strong>The air that you inhale and exhale through your mouth or nose</p><p><strong>Pronunciation:</strong> “Breth”</p><p><strong>Example: </strong>“Whenever you start to feel upset or stressed, just take a few deep breaths and you’ll calm down.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Breathe (verb)</h3><p><strong>Meaning: </strong>To inhale and exhale air through your nose or mouth</p><p><strong>Pronunciation:</strong> “Breethe”</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> “When the air is too hot and humid, I find it hard to breathe.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=4.-Complement-vs.-Compliment>4. Complement vs. Compliment</h2><p>“Complement” and “compliment” are a couple of the most confusing words in English. As homophones, they share the same pronunciation; their spellings also<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> differ by only one letter</a>. Who can blame you if you get them mixed up once in a while?</p><p>Here is more on<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> look-alike words</a> in English.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Complement (verb/noun)</h3><p><strong>Meaning:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>1. To make something complete or better (verb)</p><p>2. Something that makes something else complete or better (noun)</p><p><strong>Pronunciation: </strong>COM-pluh-ment</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> “I think tomatoes are the perfect complement to cheese—they just taste so good together!”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Compliment (verb/noun)</h3><p><strong>Meaning:</strong></p><p>1. To say something nice about someone or something (verb)</p><p>2. An expression of praise for someone or something (noun)</p><p><strong>Pronunciation: </strong>COM-pluh-ment</p><p><strong>Example: </strong>“My neighbor is so sweet. Every time I see her, she compliments my hair or clothes.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=5.-Emigrate-vs.-Immigrate>5. Emigrate vs. Immigrate</h2><p>It’s pretty common for people to use “immigrate” when they actually mean “emigrate.” To “immigrate” means to enter another country and live there. While these two words refer to a similar context, they have really specific uses.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Emigrate (v)</h3><p><strong>Meaning: </strong>To leave your country to live somewhere else (usually used with “from”)</p><p><strong>Pronunciation: </strong>EM-i-grate</p><p><strong>Example: </strong>“When my grandpa was five, his family emigrated from Italy.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Immigrate (v)</h3><p><strong>Meaning: </strong>To<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> move</a> to a new country to live (typically used with “to”)</p><p><strong>Pronunciation:</strong> IM-i-grate</p><p><strong>Example: </strong>“I’m a second-generation American. My parents immigrated to the United States in their 20s.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=6.-Ensure-vs.-Insure>6. Ensure vs. Insure</h2><p>The pronunciation difference between “ensure” and “insure” is so slight that you might not even notice it. What you should take note of, however, are their very different meanings.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Ensure (verb)</h3><p><strong>Meaning: </strong>To make certain&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pronunciation: </strong>en-SHUR</p><p><strong>Example: </strong>“To ensure we send your delivery to the correct building, can you please confirm your address?”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Insure (verb)&nbsp;</h3><p><strong>Meaning: </strong>To protect something against damage or risk by purchasing insurance</p><p><strong>Pronunciation:</strong> in-SHUR</p><p><strong>Example: </strong>“That’s a really expensive bike. I recommend insuring it in case it gets damaged or stolen.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=7.-Lay-vs.-Lie>7. Lay vs. Lie</h2><p>“Lay” vs. “lie”: The confusion is real. Here’s the thing about these two similar words: “Lay” is a<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> transitive verb</a>, meaning the action needs to be done to direct object in order to make sense.&nbsp; “Lie,” however, is intransitive, which means it makes sense without an object.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Lay (verb)</h3><p><strong>Meaning: </strong>To gently put someone or something down in a flat position (used with an object)</p><p><strong>Pronunciation: </strong>lei</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> “The baby fell asleep in her stroller. I’m going to lay her down in her crib.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Lie (verb)</h3><p><strong>Meaning: </strong>To be in a flat position on a surface (used without an object)</p><p><strong>Pronunciation</strong>: lai</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> “I love Saturday mornings because I get to lie in bed as long as I want.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=8.-Lead-vs.-Lead-vs.-Led->8. Lead vs. Lead vs. Led&nbsp;</h2><p>You’re probably wondering why there are three words here. Bear with us:</p><p>First of all, we have the noun “lead,” which is a type of metal. Then, we have the present and past tense of the verb “to lead.”</p><p>Because the metal “lead” has the same pronunciation as “led”—which is the past tense of “to lead”—it’s common for people to mistakenly write “lead” when they’re referring to the past tense verb.</p><p>For example, “Yesterday, the tour guide lead us to the historical site” (it should be “led”).</p><p>It would kind of make sense if the present and past tenses were both spelled “lead”; just take the present verb “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">read</a>” (pronounced “reed”) and the past verb “read” (pronounced “red”)!</p><p>Here is more on<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> words with several meanings</a> in English.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Lead (noun)</h3><p><strong>Meaning: </strong>A heavy, soft metal (noun)</p><p><strong>Pronunciation:</strong> led</p><p><strong>Example: </strong>“People think pencils contain lead, but they’re actually made of graphite and clay.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Lead (verb)</h3><p><strong>Meaning:</strong> To go in a particular direction and have others follow you</p><p><strong>Pronunciation:</strong> leed</p><p><strong>Example: </strong>“I know where the restaurant is. Follow me—I’ll lead the way.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Led (verb)</h3><p><strong>Meaning:</strong> The past tense of the verb “to lead”</p><p><strong>Pronunciation:</strong> led</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> “It was really dark when we got lost, but the forest ranger found us and led us to safety.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=9.-Loose-vs.-Lose>9. Loose vs. Lose</h2><p>“Loose” and “lose” have different pronunciations and super different meanings. However, as you can see, these two words have very similar spellings. It’s easy to mix up these two.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Loose (adjective)</h3><p><strong>Meaning: </strong>Not tight or secure</p><p><strong>Pronunciation: </strong>loos</p><p><strong>Example: </strong>“I don’t think you know how to tie your shoes properly. The laces are always coming loose.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Lose (verb)</h3><p><strong>Meaning:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>1. To fail at winning a game or competition</p><p>2. To be unable to find something that has been misplaced</p><p><strong>Pronunciation: </strong>looz</p><p><strong>Example: </strong>“Whenever I lose my glasses, it takes me forever to find them because I can’t see!”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=10.-Principle-vs.-Principal>10. Principle vs. Principal</h2><p>Have you ever heard the saying that you can remember the spelling of “principal” because it has the word “pal” in it, and the principal is your friend (pal)? It’s pretty ridiculous, but it does clear things up a bit.</p><p>However, that doesn’t cover everything, as “principal” has more than one meaning—and, to add another layer of confusion, it’s also pronounced the same way as “principle.”&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Principle (noun)</h3><p><strong>Meaning: </strong>Something you believe that helps you decide what is right and wrong</p><p><strong>Pronunciation: </strong>PRIN-ci-puhl</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> “I would never eat meat. It’s against my principles.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Principal (noun/adjective)</h3><p><strong>Meaning:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>1. The person in charge of a school (noun)</p><p>2. Main; most important (adjective)</p><p><strong>Pronunciation: </strong>PRIN-ci-puhl</p><p><strong>Example: </strong>“My principal reason for getting a new job was to make more money.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=11.-Desert-vs.-Dessert>11. Desert vs. Dessert</h2><p>“Desert” and “dessert” are a classic example of easily confused words due to their similar spellings and pronunciation.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Desert (noun)</h3><p><strong>Meaning</strong>: A hot, sandy, and dry land, often with sparse vegetation and little to no precipitation</p><p><strong>Pronunciation</strong>: dih-ZURT</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> “The Sahara Desert is one of the largest deserts in the world.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Dessert (noun)</h3><p><strong>Meaning</strong>: A sweet course typically eaten at the end of a meal</p><p><strong>Pronunciation</strong>: dih-ZURT</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: “I can’t wait to try the chocolate cake for dessert after dinner.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=12.-Imply-vs.-Infer>12. Imply vs. Infer</h2><p>“Imply” and “infer” are frequently mixed up because they involve understanding indirect communication, but they actually refer to different aspects of communication.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Imply (verb)</h3><p><strong>Meaning</strong>: “Imply” means to suggest or indicate something indirectly</p><p><strong>Pronunciation</strong>: im-PLAI</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: “She didn’t say it directly, but her tone implied that she was unhappy with the decision.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Infer (verb)</h3><p><strong>Meaning</strong>: “Infer” means to deduce or draw a conclusion about something from evidence or information presented</p><p><strong>Pronunciation</strong>: in-FUR</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: “Based on the evidence, we can infer that the suspect was at the scene of the crime.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=13.-Capital-vs.-Capitol>13. Capital vs. Capitol</h2><p>“Capital” and “capitol” are similar words often confused due to similar spelling and pronunciation, but they have distinct meanings related to governance and finance.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Capital (noun/adjective)</h3><p><strong>Meaning:</strong></p><li>An uppercase letter</li><li>Money or wealth used to start or invest in a business</li><li>A city where a seat of government is located</li><p><strong>Pronunciation:</strong> KAP-i-tuhl</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> “The company’s logo is designed with a capital ‘A’.” “Venture capitalists provided the necessary capital for the startup.”</p><p>“Chester visited Brasίlia, the capital of Brazil.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Capitol (noun)</h3><p><strong>Meaning:</strong> Capitol is a noun referring to the building where a legislature meets, often the seat of government at the state or national level</p><p><strong>Pronunciation</strong>: KAP-i-tuhl</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> “Paul visited the cafe in the basement of the capitol after watching a bill become a law.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=14.-Good-vs.-Well>14. Good vs. Well</h2><p>“Good” and “well” are frequently misused because they can both be positive descriptors, but they function differently in a sentence.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Good (adj)</h3><p><strong>Meaning</strong>: Describing the quality or nature of something</p><p><strong>Pronunciation</strong>: gud</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: “She hasn’t felt good about playing since her injury last season.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Well (adverb)</h3><p><strong>Meaning:</strong> Describing how something is done, indicating proficiency or manner</p><p><strong>Pronunciation</strong>: wel</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> “She played well throughout the concert, impressing the audience with her skills.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=15.-Fewer-vs.-Less>15. Fewer vs. Less</h2><p>“Fewer” and “less” are adjectives called<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> quantifiers</a> and are often used interchangeably, but they have distinct meanings based on countability.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Fewer (adjective)</h3><p><strong>Meaning</strong>: Referring to a smaller number of items that can be counted individually</p><p><strong>Pronunciation</strong>: FYOO-er</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: “The census determined that fewer people live in the city now than last year.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Less (adjective)</h3><p><strong>Meaning</strong>: Referring to a smaller amount or quantity of something that cannot be counted individually</p><p><strong>Pronunciation</strong>: LES</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> “For better health, people should use less salt in their diet.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Get the hang of the most confusing English words</h2><p>We’ve thrown a lot of information at you, so don’t be discouraged if you need a little more practice.
