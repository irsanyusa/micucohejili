He ultimately decided if he didn't flip the coin, Trump would "just use that to bully me into taking the lower fee."</p><p>So, after examining the coin to make sure it was legit, he agreed to play Trump's game. And it did not go well.</p><p>Moelis flipped the coin like some "truly bad coin flipper" and it flew across the table toward Trump, which he instantly knew was a mistake.</p><p>"I knew Donald well enough to know if that coin hits the floor, I'll never know who won the coin flip. I'll never forget trying to dive over the conference room table with all the pens in the middle," Moelis recalled in the interview.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Moelis "tried desperately to go see the coin," but before he could catch a glimpse, Trump picked it up and said, "Heads. You lose."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p7xaKlmqaTmnyntc2apZydXZZ6uK3LpWSsrKKasrV5wZqlpJ2iYrGmv8KroJudo2LBqbGMraCmnV2ZvK%2Bty51kraqlor1uu8WfnKudlGLBsHnSnpilZZFisaaty2hrpGmYmcOj</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./transition-energetique-un-debat-quel-debat.html><span>←</span><span>un dbat ?
