If so, you’re about to have the time of your life!&nbsp; We food lovers know the pleasure of enjoying dishes from different countries: the rich tastes, the variety of textures, the curiosity in discovering a flavour we’ve never tried before, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><span>the customs around the dinner table</span></strong></a>…it’s one of the best activities in life! So today, we’ve decided to collect some healthy (and tasty!) dishes from around the world. We are well aware that the concept of “healthy” changes from person to person, so we’ve tried to include different types of dishes everybody could love.</p><p>Let’s dive in. Warning: this article’s about to get mouth-watering!&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Top 10 healthy dishes from around the world</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. <strong>Spanakorizo (Greece)</strong></h3><p>This spinach rice is a traditional Greek recipe that’ll give you some of that sweet Vitamin A (as well as vitamins C and K!) in a single dish. It is usually served with lemon, fresh dill and feta cheese, giving it a zesty taste. You can eat it as is or enjoy it as a side dish. Plus? It’s extremely easy to make at home without any fancy or expensive ingredients, as you can see by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><span>this recipe</span></strong></a>!&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. <strong>Phở (Vietnam)</strong></h3><p>Phở is the Vietnamese staple dish and for a good reason: it’s low in fat and extremely comforting during colder seasons. Think of it as a bunch of key minerals and vitamins in a bowl: broth, rice noodles, herbs, a meat of choice (or tofu) and spices, which often include cinnamon, star anise and ginger. Just keep an eye on the sodium levels and keep them as low as possible to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><span>make sure you get a healthy meal</span></strong></a>!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. <strong>Süzme Mercimek Çorbası (Turkey)&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Turkish cuisine is a universe in and of itself: the variety of breakfast foods, soups, main dishes and desserts is mindblowing! But if you’re after a cosier meal, a traditional lentil soup should do the trick. Using red lentils, tomato paste, veggies and several spices, this creamy delight is often served with lemon wedges and spicy red pepper. Here’s how you can <strong><span><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">cook it at home</a></span></strong>!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>4. <strong>Bibimbap (South Korea)&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Bibimbap is a staple dish of Korean cuisine and is believed to <strong><span><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">have been served to royals</a></span></strong> in the Middle Ages. This mixed rice dish topped with vegetables, meat (or fish – that’s called Hweodopbap instead) and egg is high in calories, but also keeps you full for much longer and is highly nutritious.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>5. <strong>Tabbouleh (the Arab world)</strong></h3><p>Tabbouleh is a refreshing salad and side dish that is commonly used in the Arab world. To cook it, you can chop some parsley and mix it up with tomatoes, mint, onion, bulgur, olive oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper. And if you’re a fan of tapas, you’ll love the concept of the Arab <strong><span><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">mezze </a></span></strong>– small dishes served as appetisers. Tabbouleh is guaranteed to be there!</p><p><a href=#><strong><span>20 most spoken languages in the world</span></strong></a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>6. <strong>Bacalao Guisado (Puerto Rico)</strong></h3><p>Codfish is one of the most beloved fish in Puerto Rico, so a wonderful Puerto Rican cod stew had to be <strong><span><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">included on this list! </a></span></strong>The spices, seasonings and intense flavour will make your heart sing. The dish is tomato-based and flavoured with onions, peppers, and garlic. The salt in the recipe comes from the codfish without any extra additions, which means you’ll get a nourishing meal without too much fuss!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>7. <strong>Ratatouille (France)</strong></h3><p>Beloved by vegans, vegetarians and meat lovers alike, ratatouille is nourishing and versatile. It is a stew made of eggplants, zucchini and tomatoes, which you can serve it as is, topped with cheese or as <strong><span><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">an addition to other dishes.</a></span></strong> Because there isn’t one single, correct way of cooking ratatouille, you have absolute freedom to decide how to dice/slice the vegetables and make this recipe your own. Directly from the Provençal region of France to your table!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>8. <strong>Fish curry (Thailand)</strong></h3><p>If you’re into spicy food, we’re about to make your day! Thailand is no stranger to the <strong><span><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wonders of a diverse cuisine</a></span></strong> and just how creative you can get with flavours. The typical Thai fish curry is easy to make, filling, unique and colourful, as it is rich in coconut milk, spinach, spices and fresh fish. If you feel like it, you can also add seafood, more veggies and fresh lime to give it some extra kick!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>9. <strong>Mucapata (Mozambique)</strong></h3><p>Mucapata is a popular side dish in Mozambique and it’s made of rice, coconut and beans. Not only is it nourishing and filling, it’s also a perfect match for grills or curries! In a country where 44% of the territory is pure coast (read: breathtaking beaches!), you’re bound to enjoy fresh seafood to go with your mucapata.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>10. <strong>Aloo Palak (India)</strong></h3><p>Indian cuisine needs no introduction: saucy, creamy, comforting, warm, spicy, intense, creative…you know how it works and you’ve enjoyed its pleasures in the past. But did you know about this spinach dish? It’s vegan, it’s lemony, rich in greens and versatile (goes with a huge variety of dishes!). Here’s a <strong><span><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">step-by-step recipe </a></span></strong>showing you how to do it!&nbsp;</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Loved these suggestions?&nbsp;</strong></h4><p>Then let us tell you about the <strong><span><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best comfort food from around the world!</a></span></strong> We’ll see you there and hope you’ll share your favourite healthy dishes with us.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/lingoda-2020-favicon.png><h2>Maria Inês Teixeira</h2><p>Maria Inês has been working as a language teacher and blogger for more than 2 years.
