Even a third of 18-24 year olds – who will have been between four and ten years old when the chain closed in 2009 – want to see the store open its doors once again.</p><p>In a distant second is Debenhams, which shuttered its shops just last year. One in eight Britons (13%) would like to see a return for the barely-departed department store chain.</p><p>Rival chain BHS, which closed its stores in 2016, is also a top candidate for resurrection, with 10% wanting to see its return. Clothing retailer C&A – which exited the UK market in 2011 but still operates internationally – comes in fourth, at 7%.</p><p>No other defunct brands manage to pick up more than a couple of percentage points. Such stragglers include Toys R Us, Blockbuster, Comet, Littlewoods and Maplin.</p><p>Some Britons (1%) even seek a return for department store chain House of Fraser, which is distinctly alive, <a href=#>with 33 branches still operating in the UK</a>, as well as five further stores converted to the ‘Frasers’ format.</p><p>Only one in four Britons (23%) don’t have any high street chains they’d like to bring back from the dead.</p><p><a href=#><strong>See the full results here</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtksLC60q6knqpflr%2B1tcKlnKxnZGiBdYOMoZilnl2Xv6rAzqeqZq%2BZqLVuwMeesGabn6q5pXnBq6Cnn12XrqS3jLCmqKSnpL%2B1tNI%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./el-nino-drought-thailand-red-shirts.html><span>←</span><span>El Nio: Could Drought Mean Political Unrest in Thailand?</span></a>
