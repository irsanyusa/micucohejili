Porter, assistant executive secretary of the Illinois High School Association (IHSA) and the former teacher and coach who led the Athens High School team to a second-place finish in their tournament. Describing the way fans looked forward to the annual statewide high school basketball tournament, he wrote that a “little March madness may complement and contribute to sanity and help keep society on an even keel,” in a March 1939 issue of the organization’s magazine Illinois High School Athlete. (That’s also the same year, coincidentally, that Oregon beat Ohio State to win the first NCAA championship on Mar. 27, 1939.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In 1942, he elaborated on that sentiment in the form of a poem called <a href=# rel=noopener>“Basketball Ides of March,”</a> which appeared in another publication, the Illinois Interscholastic:</p><figure class=text-left readability=26.5><p>The Madness of March is running.<br>The winged feet fly, the ball sails high…</p></figure><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The last stanza, the first line of which refers to “war nerves tense,” appears to suggest that such feats of athleticism would help America’s then-ongoing effort in World War II, framing the tournament as an important morale booster:</p><figure class=text-left readability=26.5><p>Now eagles fly and heroes die<br>Beneath some foreign arch<br>Let their sons tread where hate is dead<br>In a happy Madness of March.</p></figure><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">That said, pinpointing who exactly came up with the term may not be a slam dunk. Though Porter frequently gets the credit, etymologist Barry Popik has also <a href=# rel=noopener>claimed</a> that the phrase was used to refer to the state high school basketball tournament in Indiana even earlier, at least as early as 1931.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Meanwhile, Brent Musburger, who covered Chicago sports before becoming an ESPN announcer, often gets the credit for associating the term “March Madness” with the NCAA tournament. That happened in the early 1980s. Usage increased as the number of participating teams increased to 64 in 1985,<b> </b>according to former CBS Sports executive Kevin O’Malley. (Now there are <a href=# rel=noopener>68</a> Division I men’s teams and <a href=# rel=noopener>64</a> Division I women’s teams in the tournament.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">There has also been some “madness” over the rights to use the phrase “March Madness.” The IHSA trademarked it in 1989, and in 1996 sued to stop an NCAA sponsor from distributing a video game with that title. Musburger <a href=# rel=noopener>acknowledged</a> that he got the term from IHSA, so the case ended in a settlement that resulted in the two entities forming the March Madness Athletic Association, which gave the NCAA license to the term with regards to college basketball and let IHSA use it for high school basketball.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Nowadays, the madness of March continues — especially when it comes to <a href=# rel=noopener>bracketology</a> — and the 2017 tournament set a <a href=# rel=noopener>new record for most-watched tournament in 24 years</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZuaWhtgHWBjqaYq5uYYrqisM2eqqxln6e2qLXNrGSwp6KZerG00Zqqnmc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./marcella-producer-lands-tv-rights-to-the-doll-factory-1202876637.html><span>←</span><span>Marcella Producer Lands TV Rights to Hot Novel The Doll Factory (EXCLUSIVE)</span></a>
