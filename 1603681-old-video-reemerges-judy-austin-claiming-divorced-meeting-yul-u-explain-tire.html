I set my eyes on Yul Edochie years after that marriage ended. I’m not saying that I met him and we started talking, I said I saw him for the first time years after my marriage was completely dissolved so anyone saying otherwise is plainly lying. If I saw Yul while in that marriage, let all the curses and insults that people have been heaping on me happen to me a billion times over but if I did not see Yul with my eyes years after my marriage was dissolved, then let all the curses go back to the people laying them a billion times over.”<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/998c3df73177e386.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Judy Austin's 1st hubby accuses Yul Edochie of having an affair with actress while she was married to him</span></p></a><p class=align-left>See <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">the video</a> shared on <a href=#>Instagram</a>.</p><h2>Nigerians react to Judy’s video</h2><p class=align-left><strong>Legit.ng</strong> gathered some comments from netizens who reacted to what <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Judy Austin</a> said in her old video.
