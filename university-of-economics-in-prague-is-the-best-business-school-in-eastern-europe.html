Every year since 2007, Eduniversal has been ranking 1000 business schools and universities from 154 countries, which are divided into nine geographic world regions. The first step of each year‘s evaluation is taken by the International Scientific Committee (ISC), comprised of 11 members, which is responsible for the Official Selection of the best 1000 business schools. The chosen universities within each country are then split into five levels of excellence according to a set of criteria designed to determine a school’s international influence, reputation and quality, especially the extent of internationalization. In the third step of the process, Rectors and Deans of the 1000 selected universities are evaluated.</p><p>Based on these criteria, the universities are divided into five groups, which are characterized by the number of palmes of excellence. Worldwide, only the hundred best schools get five palmes and VŠE is among them. Other Business Schools in the Czech Republic who achieved 3 palmes of excellence are Prague International Business School, Brno International Business School, Brno University of Technology Faculty of Business and Management and CMC Graduate School of Business.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pMbEnJ%2BuppmrsrO%2FyK2gnqtemLyue8Crq6KbnJp8trrIr5yrq5mpxm67xWacnKeepLqqr9JmoKdloKeuqMHEZqCsZaSdsm6uxKyrZpqlqLavsdKsZKybmKS8rXnIp2SemaOpsrO6jJ6sq6egmg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-real-reason-drake-bell-was-considered-missing-and-endangered.html><span>←</span><span>The Real Reason Drake Bell Was Considered Missing and Endangered</span></a>
