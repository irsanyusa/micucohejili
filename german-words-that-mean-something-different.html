Don’t worry, you’ll be expert level in no time!&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>das Pony vs der Pony</h3><p>To start off, “das Pony” is a baby horse you might see at a farm and “der Pony” is fringe hair style. You know, the type of bangs you had back in 4th grade? Yeah it’s basically the same. All that’s different here is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the sneaky German article</a>!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>das Tor vs der Tor&nbsp;</h3><p>Next, “das Tor” could be used in this statement: He scored the final goal at his soccer game, while “der Tor” is a noun that’s synonymous with fence. Here again, it all comes down to the article used.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>das Stift vs der Stift</h3><p>When we translate “der Stift” you get a pen. Sometimes it’s used to refer to a crayon or a pencil, too. On the other hand when you place “das” in front you get a “monastery.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>die Leiter vs der Leiter&nbsp;</h3><p>My next example is “die Leiter”, which is a ladder. On the other hand, “der Leiter” is a leader or manager. Think about it like this, you wouldn’t want to die on a ladder would you? By using <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">mnemonic devices</a> it can be easier to recall certain words so joint that one down for later! It’s also important to note that often “der Leiter” can also refer to a supervisor, head of a company, director, or a principal.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>die Bank&nbsp;</h3><p>This is a homonym, or a word that sounds the same but has a different meaning depending on context. It could mean either a credit institute or a bench you sit on in a park.</p><p>Let’s see these in context:</p><p>English: I sat on the <strong>bench</strong> at the park and watched the beautiful sunset.</p><p>German: Ich saß auf <strong>der Bank</strong> im Park und beobachtete den wunderschönen Sonnenuntergang.</p><p>English: I needed to withdraw money at <strong>the bank</strong>.</p><p>German: Ich musste Geld bei <strong>der Bank</strong> abheben.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>der Hahn</h3><p>Here’s a funny one: “der Hahn” can refer to a faucet that water comes out of in your kitchen sink or the animal that says- cock-a-doodle-do! Yes you guessed it, a rooster. No idea why German uses the same word here.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>die Decke&nbsp;</h3><p>Up next: “die Decke” could mean the top of your room (your ceiling), but it could also mean blanket. In the same manner, “die Decke” could also mean a cover. In the end, both instances mean to cover something, but <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the context makes it clear</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Ready to start learning with Lingoda?</h2></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>die Blume&nbsp;</h3><p>This one is a triple threat because it has three different meanings: flower, beer foam, and a bunny’s white tail. If someone uses the word “das Tier”, or animal in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sentence</a>, they’re most likely referring to a bunny’s white tail.&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s say you’re out for drinks with your co-workers and “die Blume” is mentioned. In this scenario, you can assume they’re speaking about the foam in the beer. Interestingly enough, it’s standard and expected to have “die Blume” in your draft beer, unlike in other countries where it might be frowned upon. And lastly, if someone mentions a garden or plants, they’re probably referring to a flower.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>bis vs der Biss</h3><p>The first “bis” is a preposition which is typically used for time and placed expressions. The second “Biss” is a masculine noun (der) that means bite. Let’s look at an example:</p><p>German: Als Tres den Fuß in den Bach hielt, spürte er, wie ihm etwas in den Zeh <strong>biss.</strong></p><p>English: When Tres put his foot into the stream, he felt something <strong>bite</strong> his toe.</p><p><strong>Quick note:</strong> generally when a German word has a double s as in “ss” it’s pronounced a bit longer than with one s, so if you want to be super particular, these words are pronounced just a tad bit differently.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>hast vs hasst</h3><p>Hast is a singular second person verb that means “to have” while hasst is the second or third person verb that means “to hate”. This needs some clarification so let’s try some practice sentences:</p><p>English: You <strong>have</strong> a lot of flowers in your garden.</p><p>German: Du <strong>hast</strong> viele Blumen in deinem Garten.</p><p>English: You really <strong>hate</strong> snakes.</p><p>German: Du <strong>hasst</strong> Schlangen wirklich.</p><p>Here again we have the slight pronunciation difference with the singular and double “s”.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>ist vs isst</h3><p>The first ist is a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">common German word meaning</a> “to be”. Er <strong>ist</strong> nett, or he is nice. The second isst is a form of the verb “to eat”.&nbsp;</p><p>Let me illustrate further: He eats a cookie or Er <strong>isst</strong> einen Kuchen.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re a fan of puns, you can also say “Man ist was man isst” (“You are what you eat”).</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>die Seite vs die Saite</h3><p>These are both pronounced the same but “die Seite” means side, while “die Saite” translates to string.</p><p>You can gain a further understanding here:</p><p>English: A <strong>string</strong> on my guitar broke.</p><p>German: Eine <strong>Saite</strong> an meiner Gitarre ist gerissen.</p><p>English: We live on the opposite <strong>side</strong> of the river.</p><p>German: Wir <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wohnen</a> auf der gegenüberliegenden <strong>Seite</strong> des Flusses</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>das Lied vs das Lid</h3><p>The first homophone, “das Lied” is a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">noun</a> that can be used to describe music or a song. The second word, “das Lid” is a cognate because it means the same in English as it does in German – it’s short for eyelid (the flap of skin over your eye).&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>das Becken</h3><p>Another triple threat! This one has three meanings. To start, it could translate to pool as in the one you swim in, but it could also mean your pelvis bone or musical cymbals.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>der Flugel&nbsp;</h3><p>der Flugel could mean wings on a bird or grand piano.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are a couple of examples:</p><p>German: Dieser Vogel hat wirklich große <strong>Flügel</strong>.</p><p>English: That bird has really large <strong>wings.</strong></p><p>German: Hast du schon von meinem neuen <strong>Flügel</strong> gehört?</p><p>English: Have you heard about my new <strong>grand piano</strong>?</p><p><h2 class=headline>Ready to start learning with Lingoda?</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/lingoda-2020-favicon.png><h2>Adriana Stein</h2><p>Adriana Stein is an Online Marketing Consultant based in Hamburg, Germany.
