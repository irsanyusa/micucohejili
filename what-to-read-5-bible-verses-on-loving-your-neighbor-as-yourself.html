Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.’ The second is this: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no commandment greater than these", He says.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Here are five Bible verses that prove how important this commandment is.</p><p>1. 1 John 4:21; "And this commandment we have from him: whoever loves God must also love his brother."</p><p>2. Leviticus 19:18; "Forget about the wrong things people do to you. Don't try to get even. Love your neighbor as yourself. I am the Lord."</p><p>3. Matthew 25:40; "The king will answer them, 'I can guarantee this truth: Whatever you did for one of my brothers or sisters, no matter how unimportant they seemed, you did for me.'"</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>4. Matthew 7:12; "So whatever you wish that others would do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets."</p><p>5. Romans 13:8-10; "Owe no one anything, except to love each other, for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law. For the commandments, “You shall not commit adultery, You shall not murder, You shall not steal, You shall not covet,” and any other commandment, are summed up in this word: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksLC5zK6loqyZmsBwvsSloKChn6N8uLTArWStp12nsqKwjG5km6GSobJuwsSrqp6rXaS7brjOr6Cnn12uvLa%2BjKecop%2BYl7yzecCsZLKnpafAprjFaK%2BscWSgxnM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./american-idol-alum-drag-queen-adore-delano-reunites-with-her-kindergarten-teacher.html><span>←</span><span>'American Idol' Alum, Drag Queen Adore Delano Reunites With Her Kindergarten Teacher</span></a>
