She has mostly kept a&nbsp;low profile, avoiding the limelight. However, after being seen in&nbsp;public last week, fans expressed concern about her appearance. Some said they have observed changes in&nbsp;her weight and face over time.</p><p><h2>She got candid in&nbsp;a&nbsp;TikTok video.</h2></p><p>Ariana Grande spoke out about comments regarding her body. The pop star has been the subject of&nbsp;much discussion lately, with numerous fans expressing “concern” about her weight in&nbsp;the comment section of&nbsp;her <a href=# title=Instagram data-link=tag>Instagram</a> account. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;TikTok clip that lasts 3&nbsp;minutes, the “thank u&nbsp;next” singer candidly shared her thoughts, encouraging her followers to&nbsp;think twice before sharing their views on&nbsp;other people’s physical appearances.</p><p><h2>She told them to&nbsp;hold back any remarks.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/998/c0f/ede5165430aa62364e464dd9a0.jpg><p>Grande expressed that discussing someone’s body and <a href=# title=health data-link=tag>health</a> is&nbsp;not constructive. Even well-intentioned comments could have a&nbsp;negative impact on&nbsp;someone. The singer said, “I&nbsp;just wanted to&nbsp;address your concerns about my&nbsp;body and talk a&nbsp;little bit about what it&nbsp;means to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;person with a&nbsp;body and to&nbsp;be&nbsp;seen and to&nbsp;be&nbsp;paid such close attention&nbsp;to.”</p><p><h2>She revealed that her mental state was worse back then.</h2></p><p>Ariana <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explains</a>, “The body that you’ve been comparing my&nbsp;current body to&nbsp;was the unhealthiest version of&nbsp;my&nbsp;body. I&nbsp;was on&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;antidepressants and drinking on&nbsp;them and eating poorly. I&nbsp;was at&nbsp;the lowest point of&nbsp;my&nbsp;life when&nbsp;I looked the way you consider my&nbsp;healthy, but that in&nbsp;fact wasn’t my&nbsp;healthy.”</p><p><h2>Ariana is&nbsp;absolutely healthy.</h2></p><p>Ariana reassured her fans that, contrary to&nbsp;some of&nbsp;their <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>beliefs</a>, she didn’t have any health problems. “I&nbsp;also just want to&nbsp;say: one, there are many different kinds of&nbsp;beautiful. There are many different ways to&nbsp;look healthy and beautiful, and personally for&nbsp;me, the body that you’ve been comparing my&nbsp;current body to&nbsp;was the unhealthiest version of&nbsp;my&nbsp;body.”</p><p><h2>She then added a&nbsp;bit of&nbsp;motivation.</h2></p><p>Ariana finished off with some <a href=# title=motivational data-link=tag>motivational</a> words, “The second thing&nbsp;is, you never know what someone is&nbsp;going through, so&nbsp;be&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>gentle</a> with each other and yourselves. I&nbsp;just wanted to&nbsp;extend some love your way and tell you that you’re beautiful no&nbsp;matter what phase you’re in. I&nbsp;think you’re beautiful no&nbsp;matter what you’re going through, no&nbsp;matter what weight, no&nbsp;matter how you like to&nbsp;do&nbsp;your makeup these days, no&nbsp;matter what cosmetic procedures you’ve had or&nbsp;not.”</p><p>We&nbsp;have some more celebrity talk picked especially for you. <a href=#>Here</a> Lady Gaga opens up&nbsp;about her difficult university years.
