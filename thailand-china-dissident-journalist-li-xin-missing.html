He <a href=#>surfaced in a distressed condition</a> on Chinese state television last week, making what appeared to be a scripted confession of a fatal drunk-driving accident that he was supposedly responsible for in 2003. The Thai government has so far not confirmed if there is an <a href=#>official record of Gui’s departure</a> from Thailand.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">RFA reports that Li had initially traveled to India but was refused asylum there. An application to go to the U.S. on a tourist visa was also rejected. Li’s wife and infant son had reportedly tried to join him overseas via Hong Kong but were refused entry to the enclave.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">While in India, RFA says, Li made public several purported lists of sources and topics off limits to journalists in China, giving a glimpse at the operation of the regime’s extensive propaganda machinery.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Beijing has been <a href=#>widening its dragnet</a> in recent times in pursuit of its critics and dissidents overseas. Hong Kong publisher Lee Bo — a colleague of Gui’s — is believed to have been <a href=#>abducted from Hong Kong</a> at the end of December by mainland agents, in flagrant violation of Hong Kong’s autonomy.
