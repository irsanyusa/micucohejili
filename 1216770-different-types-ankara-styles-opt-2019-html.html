This trend is smoothly moving from the last season to the current one and plays with new colors and variations. Designers offer us new modifications of the usual floral patterns in 2019. Use a vast number of various flowers in your outfits. Fabrics with bright patterns help to embody any of the most vivid images this season.</p><h3>Pink tones</h3><p class=align-left>At one-time, the pink color was undeservedly referred to as ‘glamorous’ and ‘doll’s’ colors. But in modern interpretation pink has become a regular guest of the podiums. In 2019 it’ is represented by the widest range of tones from ‘crystal rose’ and ‘strawberry soufflé’ to purple and ‘magenta.’ Pink fabric with a beautiful print is perfect for Ankara gowns as well as skirt, trousers, and blouse designs.</p><h3>Ankara tie-dye print</h3><p class=align-left>Ankara tie-dye print with intricate patterns and ‘smudges’ has survived several stages of rebirth. But in the coming season, its watercolor stains and leaking colors are not so radical and bright. Tie-dye print is used for Ankara jackets and Ankara top styles. Besides, straight or flared maxi sundress with tie-dye print is ‘must have’ for hot weather.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/3987c6aa1b429d7e.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Dresses with fringe in 2019: latest designs</span></p></a><h3>Ankara patchwork dresses</h3><p class=align-left>Colorful beach pareos have long gone out of fashion, but the designers could find a good alternative for them. Patchwork maxi dresses are appropriate on the beach and a walk around the city. Choose the intricate ornament to your taste: from Turkish cucumbers to surrealistic flowers. This season print mania reaches a new level - designers increasingly mix bright prints.</p><h3>Ankara jumpsuits</h3><p class=align-left>Overalls keep functionality trend in 2019.

A jumpsuit is an excellent choice for casual style.</p><h3>Ankara pants or shorts</h3><p class=align-left>Pants for cycling or shorts continue to conquer fashion catwalks, and designers skillfully fit them into a casual wardrobe. The most popular combination is Ankara pants for cycling with a shirt or top.</p><h3>‘Victorian’ fashion with Ankara</h3><p class=align-left>This season we are waiting for the return of a beautiful era: a large-scale retrospective of Victorian style has emerged in the collections of the season 2019. Be ready to wear Ankara gowns with corsets, sleeves-lanterns, ribbons and other items of that epoch.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/vllkyt2uagemack0r.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to look like a celebrity in ankara styles</span></p></a><h3>Trendy Ankara styles with voluminous sleeves</h3><p class=align-left>The allusion to the Victorian style in the new season is also expressed in dramatic sleeves. They adorn Ankara dresses and intricate blouses with frills and ruffles this year. In this case, the additional volume of shoulders only emphasizes femininity and doesn’t discord with the fitted gowns, unlike the hypertrophied masculine jackets.</p><h3>Different Ankara styles for ladies with lace</h3><p class=align-left>Lace is more often associated with romantic and ultra-feminine clothing. We are used to mixing Ankara and lace for evening dresses. Lace sleeves or décolleté or a large lace inset on the back is gorgeous. Nigerian ladies love lace and gladly add it to Ankara outfits. Ankara and lace attire try on a new role this season. These textiles are used in casual and even sports style in 2019.</p><h3>Ankara mini dresses</h3><p class=align-left>Ultrashort mini dresses are relevant again.

Choose the one that fits your body shape better than others.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/b6a935a25cfab753.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ Ankara styles for men to rock in Nigeria in 2024 (photos)</span></p></a><h3>Ankara gowns with sloping shoulders</h3><p class=align-left>The next exciting trend is ‘shoulders-seashells.’ Dresses and blouses with sloping shoulders become the best friends of tender girls who love air-flared designs and soft shapes.</p><h3>Ankara styles with frills and flounces</h3><p class=align-left>Anyone who wants to dress like candy can safely use a lot of ruffles in the outfits.

In this season it looks like a closed bra. Ankara top is best to wear with pants or breeches sitting at the waist, the same applies to skirts of maximum or average length. Miniskirts do not suit such a top as an image is too vulgar. A considerable variety of Ankara patterns and colors can be used for such tops. For everyday wear choose tops with ordinary tailoring. If you are going to the club take extravagant options. For making a restrained image, also try a combination of a top with an unbuttoned chiffon tunic.</p><h3>Ankara festive dresses</h3><p class=align-left>Some volume for festive Ankara dresses is ‘must have’ this season. Besides, an oversize dress helps to hide imperfect shapes in the hip area.</p><p class=align-left>Moreover, it is trendy to decorate the evening outfit with feathers or fringe. If the fringe or feathers are not placed on clothes, then let them be at least on a handbag or shoes.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/vllkyt4gte41srgjq.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>These native styles will help any guy look perfect</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The large bows are also relevant this year for festive attire. Moreover, various kinds of bows are appropriate for office blouses as well as casual, and even sport wear too.</p><h2>Colors and patterns for new Ankara styles</h2><p class=align-left>The trendiest color of 2019 according to the Pantone Color Institute is soft coral.
