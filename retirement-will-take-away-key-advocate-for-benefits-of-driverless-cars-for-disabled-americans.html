During committee hearings on self-driving car legislation, Harper often mentioned his son as someone who would benefit from driverless cars.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">When the committee’s legislation, <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>H.R. 3388</a>, also known as the SELF DRIVE Act, passed the House by a voice vote on Sept. 6, Harper put out a statement saying that “self-driving car technology is especially important for the disability community where lack of transportation options is widely viewed as one of the top impediments to employment and further advancement in society.”</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">In an email to Morning Consult on Friday, Rep. Bob Latta (R-Ohio), chairman of the Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection Subcommittee, thanked Harper “for his service and tireless advocacy on behalf of those with disabilities.”</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">But Hedtler-Gaudette said that more is needed to support the production of self-driving cars that can benefit disabled people.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">“To be honest, we were disappointed with the House bill,” Hedtler-Gaudette said. “The things that we advocated for and were most concerned with did not end up making it into the final version that passed the House in September.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6zwMico56rX6eytbXRnqSepqRixKq4y2armqOVYq64rdhmop6xXZaxt7vCmqueZZakv26uxKecn6GkqHqwsoydqaKulae5pr%2FSZpqaqqNis7C%2BjJ2grJmSobKlecCmnKuhk5a7tA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./les-regions-cherchent-imposer-leur-role-de-chef-de-file.html><span>←</span><span>Les rgions cherchent imposer leur rle de chef de file</span></a>
