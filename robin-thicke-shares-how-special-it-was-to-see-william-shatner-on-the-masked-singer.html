As Thicke said, “I know that voice like the back of my hand. I’m like, that ain’t her. I know that ain’t her.”</p><p>He and Hudson also talked about the fact that William Shatner is now the oldest contestant to ever appear on the show. The 91-year-old actor was unmasked as Knight during <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Season 8 premiere</a> last week.</p><p>“He was good friends with my dad [Alan Thicke] for like 40 years,” Thicke shared of Shatner. “He would come over for certain family gatherings. So getting to see him just reminds me of my pops and all their old friendships.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">EVERY RULE ‘THE MASKED SINGER’ CONTESTANTS HAVE TO FOLLOW IN 2022</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-hudson-s-last-tour-was-with-thicke-in-2009>Hudson’s Last Tour Was with Thicke in 2009</h2><p>During the interview, Thicke reminisced about hearing Hudson sing at the Met Gala and thinking that he wanted to write a song for her. He ended up doing just that, and the track “Giving Myself” made it onto Hudson’s self-titled debut album in 2008.</p><p>The pair also reminisced about going on tour together in 2009. That was Hudson’s first and last time touring. Thicke wondered, “Did I ruin it? Was it all my fault?”</p><p>Hudson explained that she was pregnant with her son David during that tour, so “it was a lot going on.” She added that it “creeped me out” how her son would remember songs she performed on that tour, asking, “How do you know those songs when you were in my stomach when I sang them?”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Broadway1776Cast.jpg alt="‘AGT’ Star Brooke Simpson Makes Broadway Debut in ‘1776’ Revival" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570aiZoqZdqbWqr8qeZKygkaeytHnHqK5mq6CasKqty2agrWWnlsBuwM5mqp6dXay2rbjImqRmq5iWwa%2Bx0Wamp2WknbJuucCsop6cXai2r7PEq2Y%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./malaunay-une-ville-100-en-transition-76.html><span>←</span><span>Malaunay, une ville 100 % en transition !
