<a href=../../../fargo-season-two-coen-brothers.html></a>
In my initial review of Fargo, one of the things that struck me about the miniseries was that it was a reimagining of the Coen brothers movie, but not just that Coen brothers movie. Fargo provided the setting and the spine for the show, but there were elements of Burn After Reading (Glenn Howerton’s personal trainer over his head in a blackmail scheme), A Serious Man (Stavros Milos’ fear of the vengeance of God, which ends with a terrible, quasi Biblical natural disaster), and No Country for Old Men (with Lorne Malvo seeming, like Anton Chigurh, supernatural and unkillable).</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Melissa Petermans height, relationships, movies and TV shows</h2><time>Jun 25, 2024</time>

Just one episode of&nbsp;a&nbsp;TV series is&nbsp;the result of&nbsp;hundreds of&nbsp;hours of&nbsp;work and dozens of&nbsp;takes. For example, the famous Battle of&nbsp;Winterfell in&nbsp;the 8th season of&nbsp;Game of&nbsp;Thrones took 55&nbsp;nights to&nbsp;shoot. When the scale is&nbsp;this big, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;not surprising that the production team makes mistakes from time to&nbsp;time.
We&nbsp;at&nbsp;Bright Side watched every season of&nbsp;our favorite show again and discovered the bloopers that the creators themselves missed.

Wrestling Buddies, released in the 1980s, showed the cuddly side of professional wrestling. Because of wrestling's huge youth fan base, the Buddies were a huge relief to parents who could permit violence against what was essentially a pillow in the shape of an elite pro-wrestling personality. Even superheroes like Spider-Man eventually got into the mix, which meant Spidey and Hulk Hogan could finally join forces.
