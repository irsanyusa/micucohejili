According to the report obtained by TheCable on June 6, 2024, there were speculation about a potential drug reaction based on limited post-mortem and toxicology findings.

However, the toxicology results did reveal the presence of Diphenhydramine, an anti-histamine, but the concentration detected was not deemed fatal or lethal.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Why These Westerners Fought for India's Independence</h2><time>Jun 1, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../westerners-who-fought-for-indias-independence.html></a>
For Western historians, the news of democratically minded volunteers from other countries enlisting to fight with the Ukranians against their Russian invaders might bring to mind the creation of the International Brigades during the Spanish Civil War. But there may be some Asian resonances, too. I am thinking in particular of the remarkable, but sadly forgotten story, of the British and American fighters for India’s freedom. From the late 19th century onwards, a series of exemplary individuals disavowed their citizenship of powerful, white, imperialist nations to live with and struggle alongside the subordinated peoples of the Indian sub-continent.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>A Brief History Of: The Humvee</h2><time>May 31, 2024</time>

The mighty humvee has conquered foreign battlefields, suburban soccer fields and much of the terrain between. But the vehicle has reached a crossroads: With gas prices high and warfare evolving, does it still fulfill the missions–civilian and military–it was built for?
When humvees first debuted in 1985, U.S. soldiers called them “jeeps on steroids.” More squat than sporty but superbly versatile, they served as troop carriers, command centers and ambulances.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Angelina Jolies Latest Appearance Worries People: She Looks Strange</h2><time>May 31, 2024</time>

When the March Madness basketball tournament officially starts up again, basketball fans around the U.S. will turn their attention to the best college teams in the nation.
But, though “March Madness” is now practically synonymous with NCAA college ball, the term’s origins are actually located one rung down the sports ladder.
The term “March Madness” is thought to have first been applied to the world of basketball by Henry V. Porter, assistant executive secretary of the Illinois High School Association (IHSA) and the former teacher and coach who led the Athens High School team to a second-place finish in their tournament.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Meghan Trainor Finally Releases 'Title' Music Video After Seven Years</h2><time>May 31, 2024</time>
