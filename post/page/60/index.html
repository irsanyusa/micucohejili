That's the word from one of the sources of the leaked photos, Benjamin Geskin. After originally posting the the pictures early Friday Eastern Time, Geskin, about an hour later, dubbed them "fake." Instead, Geskin believes this is what Apple's upcoming "special" iPhone will look like. Note that unlike the one in the fake photos, this supposedly real design doesn't have Apple's Touch ID fingerprint sensor on the back of the phone.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>un dbat ?

Si l'on en croit un sondage paru ce 16 janvier, le débat sur l'énergie voulu par François Hollande et officiellement lancé fin novembre 2012 est jusqu'à présent passé quasiment inaperçu auprès des citoyens. A la question "Avez-vous entendu parler de l'organisation d'un débat public sur la transition énergétique?", 79% des personnes interrogées répondent "non", et 21% "oui", selon une enquête d'opinion Ipsos* menée pour le Syndicat des énergies renouvelables (SER). Ce chiffre inquiétant sur l'impact de ce grand rendez-vous gouvernemental sur l'opinion contraste avec l'importance que donnent les Français au problème, selon le sondage Ipsos.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>A Wall Street banker describes the time Donald Trump offered to seal a deal with a $1 million coin f</h2><time>Jul 4, 2024</time>

In the early 1990s, when the newly opened Trump Taj Mahal was floundering and in need of financing, Moelis hopped a red eye to New York to take a meeting with the real estate magnate, he recounted in an interview with Institutional Investor's Julie Segal. The meeting was unorthodox, according to Moelis, then an emerging star withDonaldson, Lufkin, & Jenrette (DLJ). After stopping at 7/11 for three Big Gulps of coffee, he met with Trump, who caught him off guard by wanting to cut a deal after talking for less than an hour.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>All Things Go: How to Buy Tickets to New Yorks Female-Forward Festival, Featuring Chappell</h2><time>Jul 4, 2024</time>

<a href=../../../kamala-harris-running-mate-tim-walz.html></a>
Having studied leadership across sectors for nearly a half century, I’ve found that power sharing at the top is often harder than delegation and execution down the hierarchy of command. Leadership partnerships across sectors that work well have a secret recipe—which Kamala Harris seemed to understand but which Donald Trump seems to have missed, given their recent selections of running mate. Barack Obama and Joe Biden were primary rivals who became friends as President and Vice President, with affection and mutual support.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How Much Money Does The Notorious BIG Make?

Christopher George Latore Wallace (May 21, 1972&nbsp;- March 9, 1997), known professionally as the Notorious B.I.G., Biggie Smalls, or Biggie, was an American rapper. He is considered by many to be one of the greatest rappers of all time. Wallace was raised in the Brooklyn borough of New York City. His debut album Ready to Die (1994) made him a central figure in East Coast hip hop, and increased New York City's visibility in the genre at a time when West Coast hip hop dominated the mainstream.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Man Wanted on Murder Charges is Apprehended Blocks from DNC</h2><time>Jul 4, 2024</time>

For much of the pandemic, a mask has been as essential at the airport as a boarding pass: you can’t fly without one. The same went for trains, ferries, subways, buses, and other types of public transportation.
But on April 18, a federal judge in Florida struck down the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) public transportation mask mandate, arguing that it is beyond the scope of the agency’s power.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>12 Norse gods and goddesses: Complete guide to their names and powers</h2><time>Jul 3, 2024</time>
