Cornell began investigating the fraternity after the Office of Sorority and Fraternity Life received multiple reports of misconduct at Zeta Beta Tau in 2017, a <a href=# rel=noopener>university report</a> said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">According to the report, new members could earn “points” by having sex with women in a contest called a “pig roast.” Fraternity members were told not to inform the women they had sex with about the contest. Ties in the contest were broken with extra points awarded to the person who had sex with a woman who weighed the most.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A university spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In addition to a two year probationary period, Zeta Beta Tau is now required to conduct a chapter brotherhood review as well as an external review from its national organization by March 31. The fraternity will also have to hire a live-in advisor and participate in a bystander education program.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In a <a href=# rel=noopener>statement posted to the chapter’s Facebook page</a> on Saturday, the fraternity said it was informed of the allegations of misconduct in December. Fraternity brothers were not aware of, nor did they sanction the “pig roast” contest, the statement read.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“We, too, are in disbelief and even more so that these alleged actions may have been taken by those whom we called brothers,” the statement read. “As a result, we are looking inward to ensure this type of behavior never occurs by anyone connected with ZBT, or the campus community as a whole, on our watch.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The fraternity will conduct a full membership review, both internally and externally, in partnership with its international headquarters, according to the statement.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZuaWNtgXOFjpymq6aVoblustGaq56qnp7BunnPq6abmaSevK95z6KeZqqflsC1ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sweden-denies-recognising-sex-as-a-sport.html><span>←</span><span>Sweden denies recognising sex as a sport</span></a>
