But the best thing is&nbsp;that these methods really work and their creators explain in&nbsp;detail how to&nbsp;use them the right way.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> will tell you about the most effective tidying methods and their most interesting principles. Some of&nbsp;them will help you to&nbsp;rid your <a href=# title=place data-link=tag>place</a> of&nbsp;the things you don’t need and others will help to&nbsp;solve small, everyday tasks. Maybe, based on&nbsp;these methods, you will be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;invent your own cleaning method!</p><p><h2>1. Japanese method: “Just in&nbsp;case...”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4b9/629/148cd8501bb6cf8fd70f35bf58.jpg><p>At&nbsp;the base of&nbsp;<a href=#>Marie Kondo’s</a> method, there is&nbsp;your own picture of&nbsp;a&nbsp;perfect house. Even if&nbsp;it’s a&nbsp;rented apartment or&nbsp;house that you don’t like for some reason, you can still make it&nbsp;as&nbsp;comfortable as&nbsp;possible.</p><ul><li>Don’t start cleaning up&nbsp;before you throw away all the things you don’t need. The ritual of&nbsp;getting rid of&nbsp;stuff should be&nbsp;done at&nbsp;least every 1.5 to&nbsp;2&nbsp;months.</li><li>Try to&nbsp;estimate everything in&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;the comfort it&nbsp;gives you. You will definitely not need the things that are in&nbsp;the deepest corners of&nbsp;your wardrobe that only give you good memories. Thinking you should keep it&nbsp;“just in&nbsp;case” is&nbsp;never wise, so&nbsp;make decisions faster and don’t hold onto stuff.</li><li>Don’t measure memories with things because the memories won’t disappear if&nbsp;you throw away an&nbsp;old plate, a&nbsp;dress you used to&nbsp;wear many years ago, tickets to&nbsp;the concert of&nbsp;your favorite singer or&nbsp;an&nbsp;old grandfather’s frame.</li><li>Sort things not according to&nbsp;the room but rather, according to&nbsp;the category.</li><li>Don’t make your drawers too full! Things that are not seen as&nbsp;often are never used, so&nbsp;give them some room.</li><li>Keep things in&nbsp;a&nbsp;way so&nbsp;you can see them well. For example, if&nbsp;it’s in&nbsp;a&nbsp;cabinet, put the stuff in&nbsp;vertically.</li><li>Create a&nbsp;“place of&nbsp;power”. In&nbsp;other words, create a&nbsp;place where you can enjoy some time surrounded by&nbsp;your favorite stuff.</li></ul><p><h2>2. The hug principle</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/68b/0b8/5159de5773a6a84187f4d8aac4.jpg><p>Leo Babauta who created a&nbsp;<a href=#>blog</a> about minimalism asks you to&nbsp;think about why you buy stuff. It&nbsp;may be&nbsp;to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;feeling of&nbsp;safety, for approval, or&nbsp;for comfort. He&nbsp;advises you to&nbsp;try to&nbsp;think about what you really need and what you think you need.</p><p>When it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;cleaning, Leo loves the theory of&nbsp;“small things that are hard to&nbsp;notice” instead of&nbsp;one big thing. For example, it’s better to&nbsp;sweep the floor just as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;you notice it&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;spreading it&nbsp;around the house and cleaning the entire place.</p><ul><li>Another one of&nbsp;his principles is&nbsp;what he&nbsp;calls, the “hug method”. In&nbsp;the “hug method”, you only clean the areas you can hug with your arms without walking around the entire room. If&nbsp;you move from one area to&nbsp;another, you can finish the cleaning 2&nbsp;times faster than usual.</li><li>When deciding what you need, you should get 3&nbsp;boxes and label them as&nbsp;“keep”, “might need”, and “throw away”. Box number 2&nbsp;has the right to&nbsp;spend just 6&nbsp;months on&nbsp;your shelf before you throw the stuff away.</li></ul><p><h2>3. Messies anonymous</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ff3/fa9/25b7fc5f54942b7c8f03fcf8ad.jpg><p>This system was <a href=#>designed</a> in&nbsp;1982 by&nbsp;Sandra Felton, an&nbsp;American woman who lost her dissertation in&nbsp;her house. This was the last straw: Sandra was tired of&nbsp;feeling like she was doing something wrong, so&nbsp;she decided to&nbsp;study this problem and make her own rules.</p><p>She thinks that it’s easy to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;place clean if&nbsp;you have a&nbsp;certain order in&nbsp;it, where everything should have its own place. Teach yourself to&nbsp;put things in&nbsp;their place. This habit, just like any other, can be&nbsp;acquired in&nbsp;21&nbsp;days.</p><p>Some of&nbsp;Sandra’s rules:</p><ul><li>Ask for help. Ask your relatives to&nbsp;do&nbsp;things that don’t irritate them and help children to&nbsp;treat cleaning like a&nbsp;game with small prizes.</li><li>Use the magic of&nbsp;3&nbsp;boxes: “throw away”, “give away or&nbsp;sell”, and “put away for storage”. Make sure that the last box is&nbsp;not big: there should be&nbsp;only the most necessary things inside&nbsp;it.</li><li>If&nbsp;something takes less than 30&nbsp;seconds (for example washing one plate), do&nbsp;it&nbsp;now and forget about&nbsp;it.</li><li>From time to&nbsp;time, try to&nbsp;look at&nbsp;your house as&nbsp;if&nbsp;it’s not yours in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;decide what can be&nbsp;improved.</li></ul><p><h2>4. Burning house method</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fab/f86/17dc01584c9865e053433bc86a.jpg><p><a href=#>Alison Hodgson</a> discovered the minimalistic approach to&nbsp;organizing a&nbsp;room and started writing articles about how she relaxed her consciousness when she had a&nbsp;fire in&nbsp;her house. The family had enough time to&nbsp;save only the necessary devices and clothes; the toys and other things were burned. According to&nbsp;Alison, they couldn’t even remember what was kept in&nbsp;the farthest cabinet and they couldn’t throw them away.</p><p>Her main recommendation is&nbsp;a&nbsp;little too hopeful, but it&nbsp;still gives&nbsp;us an&nbsp;understanding of&nbsp;what is&nbsp;really valuable: ask yourself what will be&nbsp;the first things you would grab in&nbsp;a&nbsp;fire and only keep the things that really bring you joy.</p><p><h2>5. Having fun cleaning with FlyLady</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/671/20a/882251519d89731634b207677b.jpg><p>“FlyLady” is&nbsp;probably the most famous <a href=#>cleaning system</a>, mainly because the creator believes that cleaning should be&nbsp;enjoyable. Her main principle is&nbsp;to&nbsp;try to&nbsp;get rid of&nbsp;the stress brought on&nbsp;by&nbsp;long hours of&nbsp;cleaning on&nbsp;weekends. This time could have been spent with your family.</p><p>The author of&nbsp;the system recommends spending 15&nbsp;minutes per day and literally using a&nbsp;timer.</p><ul><li>During the week, pay attention to&nbsp;one area. For example, Monday for the hall, Tuesday for the bathroom, and so&nbsp;on.</li><li>Once a&nbsp;week, do&nbsp;the cleaning in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;remove dust and washing the floor, but this process should not take more than 1&nbsp;hour.</li><li>Put out the “hot spots”&nbsp;— the places where there is&nbsp;always a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;stuff: the table, the workplace, and so&nbsp;on. The cleaning won’t take more than 5&nbsp;minutes.</li></ul><p><h2>6. American “un-messing”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/423/3f1/fe8ed15f468ac6a9a2dcf45bdb.jpg><p>“Un-messing” helps to&nbsp;clean your apartment better without having too many extra things around. There are several methods:</p><ul><li>The special box: put the things in&nbsp;this box that you don’t use. Fill the box up&nbsp;once a&nbsp;month. Once a&nbsp;month, give away, sell, or&nbsp;throw away the stuff in&nbsp;the box.</li><li>1/10&nbsp;method: every 10&nbsp;days, throw away 1&nbsp;thing.</li><li>The rocket method: every day, 10&nbsp;minutes should be&nbsp;spent on&nbsp;going around the apartment and packing all the trash in&nbsp;a&nbsp;box or&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;plastic bag.</li></ul><p><h2>7. “Sparkling house” or&nbsp;“sheep and worms”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fc2/d10/7bd70858b69c5786751373c90b.jpg><p>The “Sparkling house” <a href=#>system</a> is&nbsp;based on&nbsp;the right attitude to&nbsp;cleaning: don’t take it&nbsp;as&nbsp;something global and necessarily unpleasant. This method’s creators turned cleaning into a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;everyday rituals.</p><ul><li>“Destroying evidence” means to&nbsp;clean everything right now&nbsp;— this is&nbsp;the main principle.</li><li>“Mini-routine” is&nbsp;the morning cleaning that starts from ventilating the room, making up&nbsp;the bed, watering flowers, and sorting through stuff.</li><li>“Room of&nbsp;the day” means to&nbsp;choose a&nbsp;room and do&nbsp;more in&nbsp;it&nbsp;than in&nbsp;the others. Spend about 15-30 minutes on&nbsp;cleaning&nbsp;it.</li><li>“Sheep” are the tasks for the room of&nbsp;the day&nbsp;— get rid of&nbsp;the sheep one by&nbsp;one so&nbsp;that there’s no&nbsp;huge herd by&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the week.</li><li>“Ducks” are tasks geared around un-messing the apartment, sorting stuff in&nbsp;boxes and throwing away the useless ones.</li><li>“Worms” are small everyday tasks for children that they can have fun doing, but they should get used to&nbsp;doing some work every day. They should collect their toys and sort their own clothes after washing&nbsp;— the “worms” should grow together with the child.</li></ul><p>Which of&nbsp;these systems did you like most? We&nbsp;liked the “sheep and worms” method and the 30-second rule.
