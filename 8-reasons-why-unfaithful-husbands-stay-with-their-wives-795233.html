He&nbsp;is&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>comfortable</a> with his life and is&nbsp;looking for an&nbsp;affair because he&nbsp;wants to&nbsp;try something new, not necessarily because he&nbsp;wants to&nbsp;change his life. <a href=# title=Home data-link=tag>Home</a> for a&nbsp;husband like this is&nbsp;a&nbsp;castle.</p><p>There is&nbsp;no&nbsp;question in&nbsp;his head about whether he&nbsp;should leave.<strong> He&nbsp;doesn’t want this because, without his wife, it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;difficult for him to&nbsp;manage the house. </strong>Maybe there is&nbsp;no&nbsp;<a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a> or&nbsp;passion anymore, but there are friendship and respect. He&nbsp;just wants a&nbsp;comfort zone where he&nbsp;can take the best nap.</p><p><h2>2. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;just looking for a&nbsp;“break.”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e54/fef/be75bc598eb9b922261e870f1f.jpg><p>A&nbsp;CEO of&nbsp;one dating site for married people who are looking for affairs said in&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a href=#>interview</a> that there are many of&nbsp;these types of&nbsp;cases when you have a&nbsp;good <a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a> with your partner. They are a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;a&nbsp;good <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> group, both have duties, but cheaters are not looking for a&nbsp;break-up in&nbsp;this case.</p><p>There is&nbsp;a&nbsp;big love between partners<strong>, but having an&nbsp;affair is&nbsp;just a&nbsp;time to&nbsp;relax and feel adventurous.</strong></p><p><h2>3. He&nbsp;thought he&nbsp;could find the answer about life in&nbsp;an&nbsp;affair, but hasn’t yet.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8e4/91e/0f17005ede890618819403b497.jpg><p>There is&nbsp;an&nbsp;interesting <a href=#>story</a> about a&nbsp;husband who cheated on&nbsp;his wife. Yes, it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;total disaster. The woman went through the whole spectrum of&nbsp;feelings, but after some time she started to&nbsp;ask why. He&nbsp;didn’t look like he&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;leave his family.</p><p>The answer was simple. He&nbsp;didn’t do&nbsp;it&nbsp;because there was something wrong with her or&nbsp;because she was an&nbsp;awful wife. <strong>He&nbsp;did it&nbsp;because there was something wrong with him</strong>.</p><p>Some men think that if&nbsp;there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;new woman, something will change and they will become happy, but it&nbsp;doesn’t happen. They do&nbsp;love their wives but still, they can be&nbsp;experiencing some psychological problems.</p><p><h2>4. He&nbsp;actually loves his wife.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/66e/176/b03f1f58e7819e5fd9d3f9656e.jpg><p>One woman shared her <a href=#>story</a> about dating a&nbsp;married guy. He&nbsp;was a&nbsp;gentleman and a&nbsp;nice family guy. And the main thing was that he&nbsp;was not going to&nbsp;leave his wife. So, many of&nbsp;us might be&nbsp;asking why he’s behaving this way.</p><p><a href=#>Another guy</a> was able to&nbsp;answer this question. He&nbsp;had been happily married for more than 20&nbsp;years and had kids. And yes, he&nbsp;loved his wife a&nbsp;lot, but he&nbsp;had been cheating for more than 15&nbsp;years.<strong> It&nbsp;is&nbsp;just a&nbsp;“fetish” for him</strong>. At&nbsp;the same time, he&nbsp;also feels guilty about&nbsp;it.</p><p><h2>5. He&nbsp;doesn’t have enough courage to&nbsp;change his life completely.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cb5/290/211dc05851b760f1885cc834a7.jpg><p>He&nbsp;has lived with his wife already for 10&nbsp;years and been a&nbsp;perfect husband and father, but suddenly he&nbsp;meets his soulmate. Therapist Douglas LaBier calls this a&nbsp;<a href=#>“Mind-Body” affair</a>. This new feeling can be&nbsp;very powerful and consume you from head to&nbsp;toe.</p><p>Sometimes in&nbsp;these cases, some men may prefer to&nbsp;divorce and get married again, but others can’t do&nbsp;it. <strong>They still have a&nbsp;huge connection with their wife</strong>.</p><p><h2>6. He&nbsp;feels that there are strong chains, like children or&nbsp;a&nbsp;mortgage.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a4c/6ba/c3fb4a5e8697603813a1027555.jpg><p><a href=#>A&nbsp;lawyer</a> who has dealt with many divorces shared her experience, saying that it&nbsp;is&nbsp;very painful to&nbsp;separate, but it&nbsp;is&nbsp;especially painful to&nbsp;stop being a&nbsp;full-time parent. These things can stop many people from getting a&nbsp;divorce, even if&nbsp;they are not happy together.</p><p><strong>Maybe there is&nbsp;no&nbsp;love anymore between the spouses, but the responsibilities are still there and these chains can be&nbsp;very strong.</strong></p><p><h2>7. He&nbsp;doesn’t want to&nbsp;go&nbsp;through the pain of&nbsp;getting a&nbsp;divorce.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8cb/1ca/d8bc405a7f804e847f124d1d82.jpg><p>The word “divorce” evokes millions of&nbsp;bad emotions and associations. It&nbsp;involves dealing with lawyers, fighting, splitting property, and negotiating about time management for children.</p><p>Some men may prefer to&nbsp;<a href=#>leave everything like it&nbsp;is</a>&nbsp;just so&nbsp;they don’t have to&nbsp;go&nbsp;through the tears, anger, and yelling that comes with this experience.<strong> Even if&nbsp;there is&nbsp;no&nbsp;healthy relationship anymore, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;just easier to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;lover.</strong></p><p>Besides this, he&nbsp;still doesn’t want to&nbsp;stress out his kids and wife.</p><p><h2>8. He&nbsp;realized he&nbsp;made a&nbsp;mistake when having an&nbsp;affair.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ed0/c20/df590f514a8f2894086b4b1f72.jpg><p>A&nbsp;man <a href=#>opened up</a>&nbsp;that he&nbsp;had cheated on&nbsp;his wife with her close friend. He&nbsp;totally understood that it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;horrible mistake, but now he&nbsp;is&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href=# title=pain data-link=tag>pain</a>. The guy doesn’t know what to&nbsp;do&nbsp;or&nbsp;if&nbsp;he&nbsp;should tell his wife about&nbsp;it.</p><p>Of&nbsp;course, there are many opinions about whether he&nbsp;should confess or&nbsp;not, but<strong> even if&nbsp;she found out about&nbsp;it, he&nbsp;doesn’t want to&nbsp;break up&nbsp;with her because he&nbsp;still loves her.</strong></p><p>Would you prefer to&nbsp;divorce or&nbsp;to&nbsp;forgive your partner if&nbsp;you found out that he&nbsp;had an&nbsp;affair?
