She charged him with rape and also with incest, for Anstruther MacDonald is her father. He and her mother had separated when Marjorie was 3. She had not seen him again until she was 12. When she was 14, her mother having died and her foster-father remarried, she went to live with Anstruther MacDonald. Within a year she was not only his daughter but his mistress.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Temperamental, volatile, they loved and quarreled violently. In one tantrum, she reported his crimes. He admitted his guilt and went to prison for having contributed to the delinquency of a minor. She wrote to him during the eleven months of his confinement and after he was paroled she went back to live with him in Indio, Calif, where he, a skilled electrician, onetime technical chief of Radio Station KFI, had found work as electrical foreman on an aqueduct.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The day after Christmas, 1936, they went to Phoenix, Ariz, and were married. She had borne him a son two months before. Last April they had another of their fierce quarrels and again she went to the district attorney. On July 12 a jury of the people of California will start considering what next to do with dark Marjorie and Anstruther MacDonald.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">*Last week Tennessee’s new law setting 16 years as the minimum age for brides brought 12-year-old Geneva Hamby Peel and gangling, 32-year-old Homer Peel into court at Madisonville. But Judge A. T. Stewart sent the child back to the hills with her husband in the belief that she would be better off there than with her ne’er-do-well mother or in a State institution.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaaqpOdtrexjm9ucHFga4ZwuMCwZJ2ZoqB6rq3CnaanmZyZwHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./june-15th-2020-vol-195-no-22-u-s.html><span>←</span><span>June 15th, 2020 | Vol. 195, No. 22 | U.S.</span></a>
