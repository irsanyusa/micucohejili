After his demise, other beings used his body to create the Nordic mythological Universe and became the first gods.</p><p class=align-left>But how many Norse gods are there in the beginning? Ymir's descendants were divided between two clans, namely, Aesir (warrior gods) and Vanir (fertility gods).

Loki</h3><p class=align-left>Loki was the notorious trickster god in Norse mythology. He was Odin's brother and endured a mixed relationship with the Aesir clan. Loki possesses shape-shifting abilities, which enable his trickery.
