One mother recently <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a> how she’s dealing with this situation and how her in-laws are making things worse.</p><p><h2>It&nbsp;all started when a&nbsp;baby girl was born</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/851/d15/4c41ac5c5986c57fa803397542.jpg><p>This was something&nbsp;I never expected. While I&nbsp;was pregnant, I&nbsp;was excited and hopeful and even daydreamed about having a&nbsp;little boy that looked like a&nbsp;mini version of&nbsp;my&nbsp;husband.</p><p>Fast forward to&nbsp;my&nbsp;daughter being born, and she was a&nbsp;seemingly carbon copy of&nbsp;me.... When she was a&nbsp;newborn everyone told me&nbsp;how she was my&nbsp;twin, and she had my&nbsp;nose and my&nbsp;eyes and my&nbsp;cheeks and joked that&nbsp;I had made a&nbsp;“solo baby” I&nbsp;guess&nbsp;I kinda liked&nbsp;it. It&nbsp;was sorta validating, I&nbsp;guess? Like some sort of&nbsp;small acknowledgment or&nbsp;physical representation of&nbsp;all the hard work, I&nbsp;had done to&nbsp;bring her into this world.</p><p><h2>But her in-laws made it&nbsp;difficult for her from day one</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/de8/da8/8bd0c959049aed3005cde8959d.jpg><p>I&nbsp;<a href=# title=loved data-link=tag>loved</a> that she looked like&nbsp;me, and&nbsp;I loved it&nbsp;even more cause my&nbsp;in-laws hated it&nbsp;so&nbsp;much. And honestly, I&nbsp;think this is&nbsp;probably where my&nbsp;insecurities come from, and what it&nbsp;really boils down to...is that my&nbsp;in-laws, from day one, acted very entitled to&nbsp;my&nbsp;daughter. Treated her like she was their baby and&nbsp;I was just something in&nbsp;the way. They were always looking for reasons to&nbsp;put me&nbsp;down and to&nbsp;make me&nbsp;feel irrelevant.</p><p>I&nbsp;think if&nbsp;it&nbsp;wasn’t for her looking so&nbsp;much like&nbsp;me, they would have convinced themselves that they, along with my&nbsp;husband, had made a&nbsp;baby together. They seemed to&nbsp;think if&nbsp;they could pinpoint enough traits and characteristics that came from (not my&nbsp;husband or&nbsp;their very own son) but apparently first and foremost straight from their very own genes, that it&nbsp;gave them more of&nbsp;a&nbsp;claim to&nbsp;my&nbsp;baby and they felt it&nbsp;entitled them to&nbsp;her. It&nbsp;was like a&nbsp;constant battle that she was “more” theirs cause she had a&nbsp;sneeze like my&nbsp;FIL’s brother, or&nbsp;her toes came from my&nbsp;MIL’s father, or&nbsp;her energy came from my&nbsp;FIL. It&nbsp;seemed out of&nbsp;desperation to&nbsp;take some sort of&nbsp;control or&nbsp;ownership over her.</p><p><h2>Now the baby looks like her father</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5a4/97f/2363db5721b04017190e441bb2.jpg><p>My&nbsp;FIL literally looked me&nbsp;dead in&nbsp;the eyes and made a&nbsp;disgusted face when other family members mentioned she looked identical to&nbsp;me&nbsp;or&nbsp;had my&nbsp;nose or&nbsp;whatever. And my&nbsp;MIL would chime in&nbsp;saying that her granddaughter actually looked more like her as&nbsp;a&nbsp;baby. They could never let me&nbsp;have&nbsp;it.</p><p>But now she’s a&nbsp;year old, and she’s starting to&nbsp;look more like my&nbsp;husband, and people keep telling me&nbsp;how she looks nothing like me&nbsp;and is&nbsp;his clone. And my&nbsp;in-laws are smug and are already telling me&nbsp;that they “told me&nbsp;so” and that my&nbsp;daughter is&nbsp;“100 percent all them” and “is&nbsp;all their family.” And I&nbsp;don’t know, it&nbsp;kinda makes me&nbsp;want to&nbsp;throw up&nbsp;and breaks my&nbsp;<a href=# title=heart data-link=tag>heart</a> at&nbsp;the same time.</p><p><h2>And the mother doesn’t know what to&nbsp;do</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/10f/c5f/10ad805a32bece74db277277ee.jpg><p>And, of&nbsp;course, I&nbsp;love my&nbsp;daughter no&nbsp;matter what she looks like (that goes without saying). She’s cute and beautiful, and&nbsp;I wouldn’t have her looking any other way other than herself, but&nbsp;I just can’t help but feel so&nbsp;sad and insecure. How do&nbsp;I deal with this feeling?</p><p><h2>People shared their insights</h2></p><ul><li>"I&nbsp;don’t ever tell people who their baby looks like. If&nbsp;they ask me&nbsp;directly, I&nbsp;say, “Oh, I’m so&nbsp;bad at&nbsp;knowing who the baby looks like! But she is&nbsp;adorable! What do&nbsp;YOU think?” Or&nbsp;whatever they think, I&nbsp;just agree with-“Oh yes, she DOES have your eyes and your husband‘s mouth, you’re totally right!” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>julet1815&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“You should talk to&nbsp;your husband and just tell him it’s hurtful and disrespectful to&nbsp;be&nbsp;dismissed in&nbsp;such a&nbsp;petty way. Obviously, she isn’t all his family. That’s not how making a&nbsp;kid works! Perhaps Grandma needs a&nbsp;biology lesson. But your little one is&nbsp;going to&nbsp;want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;just like you, I&nbsp;bet!” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>worriedelephants&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“It’s odd your in-laws are so&nbsp;obsessed and basically territorial over&nbsp;it, but it’s totally normal to&nbsp;want to&nbsp;look like your children and it’s understandable why you feel hurt by&nbsp;their odd obsession and comments about&nbsp;it. Children go&nbsp;through phases constantly throughout infancy and toddlerhood, kids where their looks change and they seemingly switch who they resemble more... I’m sure it&nbsp;will happen back and forth a&nbsp;few more times before she’s older.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>BlueberryDuvet&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“Your baby loves you the best. She loves your smell, your voice, and the way you hold her more than anyone else. Your in-laws know this. It’s why they have to&nbsp;keep asserting their connection to&nbsp;her. You, on&nbsp;the other hand, have nothing to&nbsp;prove. Besides, if&nbsp;they aren’t treating you with <a href=# title=respect data-link=tag>respect</a>, all you have to&nbsp;do&nbsp;is&nbsp;see them less often. If&nbsp;they are so&nbsp;obsessed with your kid, they’ll get the hint really quick.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>hecandbella&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><p>Remember that you are an&nbsp;important part of&nbsp;your child’s life, and your love and care go&nbsp;beyond <a href=#>physical resemblances</a>. It’s okay to&nbsp;feel hurt, but finding healthy ways to&nbsp;cope and communicate can contribute to&nbsp;a&nbsp;more positive family dynamic. If&nbsp;the situation becomes too overwhelming, consider seeking professional advice, such as&nbsp;counseling or&nbsp;therapy, to&nbsp;help you navigate through these feelings.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLa1eceuqa2rXai8brnUnJ9mr5iau268xKinpZ1dqbKtuIymnGalqWKvoq7YZpuonaOjwW64zqiiZqSZoLJuucRmmKecXZ56pbvNrWSkpp%2Bseri0wK1kraddmbxuhJBvbXJvXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./strategic-petroleum-reserve-gas-prices-survey.html><span>←</span><span>About 3 in 5 Voters Support Strategic Petroleum Reserve Oil Release</span></a>
