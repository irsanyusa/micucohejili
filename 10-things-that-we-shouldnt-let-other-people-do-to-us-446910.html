Until we&nbsp;are adults, we&nbsp;depend on&nbsp;our families to&nbsp;help and support&nbsp;us, but once we&nbsp;reach adulthood, it’s important to&nbsp;make our own decisions. We&nbsp;can learn how to&nbsp;reduce the negative influence of&nbsp;those who do&nbsp;not wish&nbsp;us well and even protect ourselves from it&nbsp;by&nbsp;not allowing people’s thoughts and opinions invade our hearts and minds.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> thinks that you should feel in&nbsp;control of&nbsp;your life. Only you can decide what you should take with you and what you should leave behind today.</p><p><h2>Never let people:</h2></p><p><h2>10. Drag you into senseless debates</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cc9/017/05b88052a3b5ef06fc22b1bf0f.jpg><p>Don’t waste your time trying to&nbsp;prove anything to&nbsp;a&nbsp;person that has already made up&nbsp;their mind and accepts only their own truth. Yes, there are people that try to&nbsp;understand you but they can’t. But there are also people who don’t want to&nbsp;understand.<strong> Is&nbsp;it&nbsp;worth wasting your time and effort?</strong></p><p>We&nbsp;can say the same thing about people that just misunderstand you and don’t get you. The thing&nbsp;is, it’s not your problem. So&nbsp;leave it&nbsp;as&nbsp;it&nbsp;is. A&nbsp;series of&nbsp;won arguments is&nbsp;not a&nbsp;reason to&nbsp;be&nbsp;proud. The moments when you manage to&nbsp;keep silent and let the situation go&nbsp;are much more important.</p><p><h2>9. Make you feel ashamed about your past</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b74/7c7/a4805453db81d091853713fa05.jpg><p>There are people that are always ready to&nbsp;remind you of&nbsp;your mistakes and past failures. But your past belongs to&nbsp;you and everything that happened is&nbsp;part of&nbsp;your life experience and you should never let anyone make you feel ashamed. <strong>No&nbsp;matter what your past holds, remember that no&nbsp;one can change&nbsp;it.</strong></p><p>You open your heart up&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;person, and they use it&nbsp;to&nbsp;drive you into a&nbsp;corner and assert themselves. Such people are harmful to&nbsp;our happiness. Everyone has their own secrets and past history. Don’t be&nbsp;afraid of&nbsp;being judged.</p><p><h2>8. Deceive you</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/24e/aef/ffa9a85109a6083e4d3d47d9a2.jpg><p>The more you try not to&nbsp;notice someone’s lies, the faster they will replace your reality. If&nbsp;you catch someone lying, don’t keep silent. Your patience will only make things worse and will allow the liar to&nbsp;feel that their deception is&nbsp;working. And that’s when people start lying constantly.</p><p><strong>Don’t tolerate lies over and over again and don’t allow yourself to&nbsp;be&nbsp;manipulated by&nbsp;others.</strong></p><p><h2>7. Convince you that changes are bad</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/011/092/b457745492a0b9ad4863dd88ba.jpg><p>There are people who are afraid of&nbsp;changes. They don’t want to&nbsp;move on&nbsp;and get acquainted with anything new. So&nbsp;you should stay true to&nbsp;your opinion and try not to&nbsp;let others influence you.<strong> All in&nbsp;all, those people are controlled by&nbsp;uncertainty and fear.</strong></p><p>Changes in&nbsp;life often have lots of&nbsp;advantages. We&nbsp;need them to&nbsp;feel alive and to&nbsp;move forward. And it’s sometimes the most difficult experiences that bring&nbsp;us to&nbsp;where we&nbsp;need and want to&nbsp;be.</p><p><h2>6. Abandon your favorite hobbies</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/deb/87e/70c6015e8d9ce19e41edbef856.jpg><p>When you do&nbsp;something that is&nbsp;really important to&nbsp;you, you feel happy. If&nbsp;your hobby makes you smile and makes your happy, then you’re definitely heading in&nbsp;the right direction. Don’t let others stand between you and your happiness. <strong>If&nbsp;someone doesn’t share the same enthusiasm, it’s their problem and most definitely not something you should be&nbsp;concerned about.</strong></p><p>Your ideas and thoughts belong to&nbsp;you. Keep going, develop your skills to&nbsp;reach your goals, and make all of&nbsp;your dreams come true.</p><p><h2>5. Convince you that you need more</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c1c/a42/4c56f450eeb07ae5b4df359375.jpg><p>It’s very important to&nbsp;be&nbsp;grateful for what you have. If&nbsp;you demand impossible things of&nbsp;yourself and let people do&nbsp;the same, you let yourself down. Appreciate what you have. That’s where your happiness begins.</p><p>A&nbsp;constant desire for more is&nbsp;not usually a&nbsp;reason people like to&nbsp;give more. If&nbsp;you don’t complain and coerce as&nbsp;much,<strong> people would be&nbsp;more willing to&nbsp;give you more than if&nbsp;you were to&nbsp;constantly ask for more.</strong></p><p><h2>4. Convince you to&nbsp;take risks</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/67b/a8f/17991c5d14a7fc054304dd2c60.jpg><p>It’s impossible to&nbsp;achieve anything without spending time and effort. Yes, there are people that manage to&nbsp;reach their goals easily. But those are exceptions to&nbsp;the rule. People have different approaches to&nbsp;different situations and act how they want to&nbsp;and how they see fit. Someone’s actions may not be&nbsp;how you would like to&nbsp;act and that’s perfectly normal.</p><p><strong>Believing in&nbsp;yourself and your future is&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;your road to&nbsp;success.</strong></p><p><h2>3. Talk you out of&nbsp;putting in&nbsp;more effort</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d3b/8f4/f24085523fb038c95a9ec772fe.jpg><p>Sometimes when a&nbsp;goal is&nbsp;almost achieved, we&nbsp;come across certain difficulties that upset&nbsp;us. Caring people understand that this is&nbsp;when you need their support the most and they try to&nbsp;cheer you&nbsp;up, or&nbsp;even help you. <strong>But there are also those who can make you doubt yourself.</strong></p><p>Be&nbsp;persistent. When we&nbsp;struggle through tough times, we&nbsp;become stronger. We&nbsp;should keep our ideas in&nbsp;mind and follow them. When you achieve your goals, you understand how precious this experience&nbsp;is. Don’t let the opinions of&nbsp;others influence your future. <strong>Remember that starting out is&nbsp;the most difficult part, but that’s how great and important things come to&nbsp;be.</strong></p><p><h2>2. Keep you from chasing your dreams</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c69/8e9/fbe4f6576ab057635187bd7341.jpg><p>As&nbsp;we’ve already said, valuable things don’t come that easy. The path to&nbsp;success is&nbsp;often paved with lots of&nbsp;challenges such as&nbsp;criticism, disapproval, and bad reviews. And it&nbsp;can defeat&nbsp;us. Especially when our friends and relatives don’t believe in&nbsp;us.</p><p>In&nbsp;the beginning, everyone faces criticism and other difficulties. But such challenges make&nbsp;us stronger. <strong>If&nbsp;you really know what you want, follow your dream no&nbsp;matter what happens.</strong></p><p><h2>1. Choose your friends</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/940/bea/e834265bf8857b20fbeeb01489.jpg><p>Such situations happen when bad people try to&nbsp;affect your relationship with good people. <strong>Don’t let such people estrange you from those who appreciate your <a href=# title=friendship data-link=tag>friendship</a>.</strong> Be&nbsp;with those whose presence adds color and richness to&nbsp;your life.</p><p>Leave all malevolent people behind and don’t regret&nbsp;it. <strong>This is&nbsp;necessary because that’s the way people who wish you happiness stay with you.</strong></p><p>Tell&nbsp;us what boundaries you have that you wouldn’t let anyone cross. How do&nbsp;you usually understand that it’s time to&nbsp;break off a&nbsp;friendship or&nbsp;relationship when someone’s not treating you right?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH5xedOhoKefo2LBqa3TZq6eZaOdvLa4w6erZqSVqXqwwMeeqWaolaS9rbGMnaZmrJ9iwrR5k21tcmlgZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1574726-refused-church-allegedly-returns-ladys-tithe-ends-membership-letter.html><span>←</span><span>&amp;quot;You Have Refused&amp;quot;: Church Allegedly Returns Lady's Tithe to Her, Ends Her Membership in Letter</span></a>
