They are loved by&nbsp;critics and fashion magazines and there are hundreds of&nbsp;photos of&nbsp;them dressed in&nbsp;perfect combinations of&nbsp;clothes and accessories. And very few people actually remember that just 10-15 years ago, these fashion icons were only just looking for their style and making mistakes while building their wardrobes.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> decided to&nbsp;remember what path these 18&nbsp;famous women walked to&nbsp;become true gurus of&nbsp;style and fashion.</p><p><h2>18. Victoria Beckham</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9ed/e26/fe87fb5d758d80281f64261a76.jpg><p>Victoria Beckham is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the women that has managed to&nbsp;turn their careers around 180 degrees and find themselves in&nbsp;a&nbsp;totally different field. Just 15&nbsp;years ago, the entire world knew Victoria as&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the members of&nbsp;the Spice Girls and the wife of&nbsp;a&nbsp;famous soccer player. But today, Posh Spice has become one of&nbsp;the icons of&nbsp;the fashion world and the owner of&nbsp;a&nbsp;successful <a href=#>brand</a>.</p><p><h2>17. Natalie Portman</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d28/d08/ea4743599185edc775d1a2595a.jpg><p>Since her very first appearance on&nbsp;the Red Carpet, <a href=# title="Natalie Portman" data-link=tag>Natalie Portman</a> has always chosen feminine styles and simple colors. Over time, her outfits have become more well-thought-out and elegant. Also, the star of&nbsp;Black Swan prefers dresses from Dior and Givenchy that really highlight her style.</p><p><h2>16. Cate Blanchett</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/372/b69/a5655e569aabf3a14fb6a96eaa.jpg><p>Throughout her entire career, Cate Blanchett has chosen not only the most interesting <a href=#>roles</a>, but also some very memorable outfits. And just 10&nbsp;years ago, this Australian star made a&nbsp;few style mistakes here and there, but today her looks are always absolutely impeccable.</p><p><h2>15. Nicole Kidman</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/56d/4fd/14aec755e4aa674fbf35d10c52.jpg><p><a href=# title="Nicole Kidman" data-link=tag>Nicole Kidman</a> is&nbsp;definitely one of&nbsp;those women who is&nbsp;not afraid of&nbsp;experimenting with their clothing. This Hollywood star has a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;different dresses in&nbsp;her collection, but she still prefers clothes from Balenciaga, Lanvin, L’Wren Scott, Prada, and Dries Van Noten. Yes, in&nbsp;the past, her clothes might’ve been weird at&nbsp;times, but today, every time she appears in&nbsp;public, her fans and fashion critics love her style.</p><p><h2>14. Sarah Jessica Parker</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/25c/398/f453b35b2cbd34980695b02484.jpg><p>When we&nbsp;hear the name Sarah Jessica Parker, the first thing that pops up&nbsp;in&nbsp;our minds is&nbsp;her character Carrie Bradshaw who wore slightly extravagant, but still impressive outfits. At&nbsp;the moment, this 53-year-old fashion guru doesn’t need a&nbsp;stylist to&nbsp;know what to&nbsp;wear. Most of&nbsp;the time she even ends up&nbsp;making a&nbsp;good impression on&nbsp;people who are not all that interested in&nbsp;fashion. Even though the show ended a&nbsp;long time ago, Parker still loves her Manolo Blahnik shoes.</p><p><h2>13. Angelina Jolie</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/011/041/72d555583e89f1a9b6d8ca6265.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the past, <a href=# title="Angelina Jolie" data-link=tag>Angelina Jolie</a> used to&nbsp;choose jeans and bright prints, both as&nbsp;her everyday clothes and when it&nbsp;came to&nbsp;outfits for special occasions. Now, the actress wears more feminine clothes in&nbsp;very simple colors. And fashion critics totally agree with Jolie&nbsp;— her appearance doesn’t need any additional accessories.</p><p><h2>12. Natalia Vodyanova</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5e5/fc0/81df7d5c978a91b64ab377a1e7.jpg><p>When this world-famous model was taking her first steps in&nbsp;the fashion world, her style was memorable, but a&nbsp;little bit too extravagant. At&nbsp;the moment, Natalia Vodyanova has found her own unique style, but she is&nbsp;still able to&nbsp;shock everyone from time to&nbsp;time when she wears a&nbsp;<a href=#>balloon</a>-dress, for example.</p><p><h2>11. Jennifer Lopez</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/503/a1d/da736a5070a4ac0a774921807c.jpg><p>After the release of&nbsp;the single Jenny from the Block in&nbsp;2002, <a href=# title="Jennifer Lopez" data-link=tag>Jennifer Lopez</a> actively supported the image of&nbsp;the girl “everyone knows.” A&nbsp;playful beret, a&nbsp;top, and capris&nbsp;— this is&nbsp;what 34-year-old Lopez would’ve easily worn for a&nbsp;public event. Now, this star tries to&nbsp;choose more elegant clothing.</p><p><h2>10. Kate Winslet</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/61e/656/55e68350d59336e4707e4b3751.jpg><p>The free-spirited Clementine from Eternal Sunshine of&nbsp;the Spotless Mind didn’t care about what she was wearing, but <a href=# title="Kate Winslet" data-link=tag>Kate Winslet</a> herself spent a&nbsp;long time looking for “her” own style. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result of&nbsp;many fashion experiments, the English star realized that sheath dresses and suits are the best choices for pretty much any event. And she is&nbsp;used as&nbsp;an&nbsp;example by&nbsp;many other women.</p><p><h2>9. Scarlett Johansson</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3cc/ea3/5498aa591682e18ca59e21e17c.jpg><p>At&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;her career, <a href=# title="Scarlett Johansson" data-link=tag>Scarlett Johansson</a> used to&nbsp;wear clothes that attracted attention to&nbsp;her breasts. But recently, the style of&nbsp;the actress has become way more elegant. Scarlett often experiments with the colors and shapes of&nbsp;her clothes and now, nobody can criticize this talented blonde actress for having poor taste in&nbsp;clothing.</p><p><h2>8. Blake Lively</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dd0/333/ba65ff5f6ab4c6e45d4e3883b2.jpg><p>Before the&nbsp;TV series <a href=#>Gossip Girl</a> was released that made the blonde a&nbsp;real star, <a href=# title="Blake Lively" data-link=tag>Blake Lively</a> used to&nbsp;wear simple jeans and tops. And just recently, Ryan Reynolds’ wife has been the center of&nbsp;attention for the fashion public for her impeccable choice of&nbsp;clothing. And also, there are rumors that the actress doesn’t hire any stylists and bases her clothing choices solely on&nbsp;her own decisions.</p><p><h2>7. Kate Middleton</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6d2/8e3/553e8d5dea9d7975dfcd28e7ff.jpg><p>Before she became the Duchess of&nbsp;Cambridge, <a href=# title="Kate Middleton" data-link=tag>Kate Middleton</a> was not very different from most young English girls. But after her marriage, the style of&nbsp;Prince William’s wife changed dramatically and became more planned. But because the Duchess supports the idea of&nbsp;conscious consumption, she often buys clothes from mass-market brands. And also, Kate is&nbsp;not afraid of&nbsp;wearing the same piece of&nbsp;clothing more than once.</p><p><h2>6. Beyoncé</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/57d/0a7/2e7f4e539ba12ad7e1778b2ea0.jpg><p>Very few people can orchestrate an&nbsp;entire <a href=#>show</a> almost every time they appear in&nbsp;public. And we&nbsp;think that we&nbsp;will probably never again see Beyoncé wearing ordinary jeans and a&nbsp;T-shirt at&nbsp;a&nbsp;public event.</p><p><h2>5. Alessandra Ambrosio</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1be/84d/dd9ca75823ae87a192fff6f821.jpg><p>At&nbsp;the very beginning of&nbsp;her career, Alessandra Ambrosio appeared in&nbsp;very revealing and tight dresses that showed off her long legs and her great body&nbsp;— she was a&nbsp;<a href=#>Victoria’s Secret</a> angel, after all. Now, this Brazilian supermodel has replaced the revealing dresses with more conservative ones and she looks way better than she did 10&nbsp;years ago.</p><p><h2>4. Heidi Klum</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e1d/0e4/26a7af55dc8da751efb86affa5.jpg><p>Her perfect appearance allows this German supermodel to&nbsp;wear pretty much anything and still look amazing. But in&nbsp;recent years, Heidi Klum’s style has become more well-thought-out and memorable. And it&nbsp;looks like this <a href=#>mother</a> of&nbsp;4&nbsp;is one of&nbsp;those that only gets better with age.</p><p><h2>3. Adriana Lima</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/85e/676/12c6a3510aa2bc4d1058554dae.jpg><p>A&nbsp;welcoming smile and an&nbsp;unusual appearance made this Brazilian beauty one of&nbsp;the most important models of&nbsp;recent times. At&nbsp;the moment, Adriana Lima chooses her dresses for public events perfectly, but at&nbsp;the start of&nbsp;her career, she made some mistakes. Unlike many other celebrities, this “angel” didn’t make that many mistakes.</p><p><h2>2. Julianne Moore</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e03/ded/eeb0ed57eabb5cd8885ffc9e33.jpg><p>Julianne Moore’s style of&nbsp;today is&nbsp;based on&nbsp;dark colors, simple shapes, and complicated details. It&nbsp;took the actress many years of&nbsp;experimenting with fashion before she learned which outfits suited her best. And today, she is&nbsp;considered to&nbsp;be&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the trendiest women in&nbsp;the world.</p><p><h2>1. Halle Berry</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1fe/3c8/ef4855589884344dbf0421350b.jpg><p>Everyone is&nbsp;amazed by&nbsp;the perfect body of&nbsp;this 51-year-old actress. And it&nbsp;seems that Halle Berry herself knows that she looks amazing, so&nbsp;she highlights the best parts of&nbsp;her body. At&nbsp;the very start of&nbsp;her career, she might’ve worn a&nbsp;top and a&nbsp;mini skirt, but now Halle prefers more elegant outfits.</p><p>Whose style do&nbsp;you like the most? Tell&nbsp;us why in&nbsp;the comment section!</p><p>Angelina Jolie’s <a href=#>parenting style</a> was further highlighted in&nbsp;another article, where her unconventional educational approach, acceptance of&nbsp;junk food, and emphasis on&nbsp;celebrating diversity were discussed. Jolie’s approach to&nbsp;parenting is&nbsp;marked by&nbsp;a&nbsp;deep respect for her children’s individuality and a&nbsp;commitment to&nbsp;nurturing their growth.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSprdNmaHFllpa6sMHSZq6opZWjeq27zqScnWWcnrimecGenaiqlWLBqbHYZpmem5Gism6%2F07KjnmWZmLyvv4yfpqtlnZ65rbXOp6pmp5Zivaa7z6WcZm9paoN4f44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./une-circulaire-precise-les-regles-de-derogation-aux-delais-de-communicabilite-des-archives.html><span>←</span><span>Une circulaire prcise les rgles de drogation aux dlais de communicabilit des archives publ</span></a>
