Read on.</p><h2 id=our-picks-for-the-best-cooling-sheets>Our picks for the best cooling sheets</h2><h3>The best deep pocket cooling sheets: <a rel=nofollow href=#>CGK Unlimited Extra Deep Pocket Sheets Set</a></h3><p>If you’re the type of sleeper who prefers to sleep on a mattress only marginally less tall than you, it can be tough to find sheets deep enough to accommodate it. That’s why CGK’s deep pocket set is such a good find. “The CGK Unlimited Extra Deep Pocket Sheets Set accommodates thicker mattresses and has cooling properties,” says Brad Smith, interior designer and CEO at <a rel=nofollow href=#>Omni Home Ideas</a>. Made of bamboo-derived rayon and available in 14 colors, it’s a sheet you’ll want to sink into.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Material: Bamboo rayon</li><li>Sizes available: Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, Cal King, Split King</li><li>Return policy: Sheets can be returned for up to 30 days, provided they’re unused and unwashed</li><li>Pocket: Fits mattresses 18-24 inches</li><li>Price on publish: $38.99-79.99</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Great for deep mattresses</li><li>Very soft</li><li>14 color options</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Some reviews complain that they get very wrinkled when drying</li></ul><h3>The best value cooling sheets: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Mellanni Bed Sheet Set</a></h3><p>Considering how often being on a tight budget can keep you up at night, sheets that are both cooling and inexpensive might be just what you need to help you drift off. “These are brushed microfiber bedding,” says Smith. “They’re affordable, durable, and come in a variety of colors.” With 86% of Amazon reviews in the 4-5 star range, it’s clear plenty of people are sleeping better already.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Material: Double brushed microfiber</li><li>Sizes available: Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, Cal King, Split King</li><li>Return policy: Prepaid returns, refunds in 1-5 business days</li><li>Pocket: Fits mattresses up to 16 inches</li><li>Price on publish: $35.27-$45.27</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Inexpensive</li><li>10 color options</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>A minority of reviews complain the sheets feel too thin</li></ul><p><span class=best-for>Best value</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Mellanni King Size Sheets Set - 4 PC Iconic Collection Bedding Sheets & Pillowcases - Hotel Luxury, Soft, Cooling Bed Sheets - Deep Pocket up to 16" - Wrinkle, Fade, Stain Resistant (King, White)</h3></p><h3>The best splurge cooling sheets: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Parachute Percale Sheet Set</a></h3><p>“The Parachute percale sheet set offers a luxurious feel and superior breathability,” says Smith. Made from long-staple Egyptian cotton, the percale fabric (that is, tightly-weaved fabric with a crisp feel) is lightweight and generally cool to the touch. Available in nine neutral colors, they’re available with or without a top sheet.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Material: Egyptian cotton</li><li>Sizes available: Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, Cal King</li><li>Return policy: Free returns within 60 days</li><li>Pocket: Not listed</li><li>Price on publish: $129-$169</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>9 color options</li><li>Multiple reviews mention how good they are at keeping you cool</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Some reviews state that the sheets are not soft enough</li></ul><p><span class=best-for>Best splurge</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Full Percale Sheet Set in Beige | Parachute</h3></p><h3>The best bamboo cooling sheets: <a rel=nofollow href=#>LuxClub 6 PC Sheet Set Bamboo Sheets</a></h3><p>If you haven’t considered bamboo sheets before, well, why not start now? “Bamboo is a natural fiber that’s not only cooling, it’s also fairly eco-friendly,” says Sydney Decesare, accessories category manager at <a rel=nofollow href=#>Mattress Firm</a>. “Bamboo sheets ventilate well, feel lightweight, are durable, flexible, and super soft.” If you’re keen to give them a try, Smith recommends LuxClub’s offering, noting that they’re “known for their breathability and softness.” Add to that the fact that they’re available in 36 colors, and you can almost certainly find something that works for you.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Material: 40% bamboo, 60% microfiber</li><li>Sizes available: Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, Cal King, Split King</li><li>Return policy: Not listed</li><li>Pocket: Fits mattresses up to 18 inches</li><li>Price on publish: $27.95-$44.95</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>36(!) color options</li><li>Majority of reviews rave about their softness</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Some reviews mention issues with pilling</li></ul><p><span class=best-for>Best bamboo</span></p><p><h3 class=title>LuxClub 6 PC Sheet Set Bamboo Sheets</h3></p><h3>The best cooling cotton sheets: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Brooklinen Classic Core Sheet Set</a></h3><p>You’ve almost certainly slept on cotton sheets before, but it’s worth remembering why it’s such a popular material. “Among one of the softest types of sheets and most popular textile fibers on the planet, cotton is incredibly breathable, soft to the touch, and absorbent, making it another excellent fabric choice for cooling bedding,” says Decesare. These particular sheets, says Smith, are “made of 100% long-staple cotton and have a crisp and cool feel.”</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Material: Cotton</li><li>Sizes available: Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, Cal King</li><li>Return policy: Can be returned within a year, for a $9.95 fee</li><li>Pocket: 16 inches</li><li>Price on publish: $125.10-$188.10</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>11 color options</li><li>Light and breathable</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><p><span class=best-for>Best cotton</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Brooklinen Classic Percale Core Sheet Set size King in Cream</h3></p><h3>The best cooling linen sheets: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Sijo LuxeWeave Linen Sheet Set</a></h3><p>“Linen is a great sheet material to choose for a cool night's sleep,” says Byron Golub, vice president of product and merchandising at <a rel=nofollow href=#>Saatva</a>. “It can absorb up to 20% of its weight in moisture before feeling wet, meaning it will keep you dry and comfortable throughout the night. The highest quality linen is made from French or Belgian flax.” This French linen set, made from 100% organic flax fibers, has been stonewashed to ensure it’s soft right away, and was voted the best cooling sheet set of 2023 by the <a rel=nofollow href=#>National Sleep Foundation</a>.

Decesare is here to help. “Sateen and percale are the two main types of sheet weaves,” she says. “Sateen sheets are super soft and tend to be more wrinkle-resistant, while percale is known for being crisp and cool, but they may wrinkle more than sateen.” These sateen sheets—which Smith notes are “breathable with a lustrous sateen weave”—are made from 100% long-staple cotton, and per multiple reviews, are the closest you’ll get to luxurious hotel-style sheets for this price.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Material: Cotton</li><li>Sizes available: Twin, Full, Queen, King, Cal King, Split King</li><li>Return policy: Sheets can be returned for up to 30 days</li><li>Pocket: 18 inches</li><li>Price on publish: $49.99-$79.99</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>10 color options</li><li>Durable</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>A small number of reviews say they don’t feel soft enough</li></ul><p><span class=best-for>Best sateen</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Feather & Stitch 500 Thread Count 100% Cotton Stripe Sheets</h3></p><h2 id=what-to-consider-when-buying-cooling-sheets>What to consider when buying cooling sheets</h2><p>“As your body temperature naturally decreases at night—a process that helps you to become drowsy and fall asleep—the bedding you choose is an essential factor in creating the ideal sleep environment,” says Golub. “Research also shows people sleep better in a cooler space. The ideal room temperature for sleep is somewhere between 60 and 67 degrees Fahrenheit, therefore, anything that causes you to be too hot can disrupt your sleep. Beyond setting the thermostat to an appropriate temperature, it's a good idea to consider the role of your bedding, since some materials sleep hotter than others. When it comes to sheets, in particular, there are a few things to consider for a cool, comfortable night's sleep.”</p><p>“Some sheets are cooler than others due to several factors, such as the material they're made from, the type of weave, and even their color,” Golub continues. “Natural materials offer the best breathability and airflow. Cotton, linen, bamboo, and eucalyptus are the best materials for cooler sleep. When shopping for bedding, identifying the right material and weave for your needs is crucial to finding the right sheet.”</p><p>While investing in the <a rel=alternate href=#>best bed sheets</a> can help you stay cool, your other bedding choices matter, too. For instance, consider where you lay your head: The <a rel=alternate href=#>best pillows</a> for those who run hot tend to be made of breathable latex, down or down alternatives, or include features like cooling gel.</p><h2 id=how-do-cooling-sheets-work>How do cooling sheets work?</h2><p>“Cooling sheets work to keep your body cool throughout the night by wicking away heat from your body and dispersing it elsewhere,” explains Decesare. “The right kind of cooling sheets will help prevent your body from overheating by allowing for better airflow as you sleep. These sheets help sleepers maintain lower internal temperatures at night because of the high breathability and moisture-wicking properties. Some cooling sheets are made with breathable fabrics, such as cotton, bamboo, or Tencel, and some actually are made with phase-change material (PCM), a substance that releases and absorbs energy to provide cooling or heating properties.”</p><h2 id=the-best-thread-count-for-cool-sheets>The best thread count for cool sheets</h2><p>While the debate about the <a rel=alternate href=#>best thread count for sheets</a> is usually focused on quality, however, this number can give you guidance on the cooling factor of a sheet set. “Thread count refers to how many horizontal and vertical threads a sheet has per square inch,” says Golub. “But a higher thread count doesn't necessarily equal more comfortable sheets—the National Sleep Foundation recommends choosing sheets with a thread count between 200 and 400 for optimal coolness. When the thread count of your sheets is too high, the fabric won't breathe well, trapping body heat and making for a hotter, more uncomfortable night's sleep.”</p><p>“A common misconception is that the higher the thread count, the superior the bed sheet,” adds Decesare. “This just simply isn’t the case. The higher the thread counts, the heavier the sheet. A higher thread count typically means a tighter construction and higher heat retention. Optimal thread count varies depending on fabric type: 1,000 and higher means a sheet will be thicker and keep you warmer at night.”</p><h2 id=how-we-selected-the-best-cooling-sheets>How we selected the best cooling sheets</h2><p>We made our selections through a combination of expert advice, thorough research, and overwhelmingly positive customer reviews.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>Do cooling sheets really work?</h3><p>“Some cooling sheets are better than others,” says Isfira Jensen of <a rel=nofollow href=#>Nufacet Interiors</a>. “Their effectiveness is based on the fabric type, thread count, fabric weave, and if there are any infused cooling technologies.”</p><h3>Are lower thread count sheets cooler?</h3><p>“In general, there isn't a single optimal thread count for sheets,” says Golub. “Depending on the sheet material, there is typically an ideal range of thread count, usually somewhere between 180 to 600. Certain bedding yarns are larger than others, so it's important to remember that it's not an apples-to-apples comparison most of the time–linen fibers, for example, are significantly larger than that of cotton, so linen sheet thread counts are always lower than sateen and percale cotton sheets. But you typically don’t want to go below 180 thread count for any woven sheet material. While a sheet below that threshold may feel super light and breathable (which is certainly desirable by some sleepers), the fabric simply isn’t strong enough to withstand normal use and routine wash cycles.” For further advice on caring for your bedding, check out our guide on <a rel=alternate href=#>how often you should wash your sheets</a>.</p><h3>What kind of sheets feel cool and crisp?</h3><p>“Cotton, the most popular sheet fabric today, offers great airflow and moisture-wicking properties,” says Golub. “Opt for organic cotton to get the best breathability. The type of weave is another factor to consider when looking for the best cotton sheets to keep you cool. The two most common types of sheet weaves are sateen and percale—of these two, percale is the more breathable option.”</p><p>“Percale sheets are known for feeling cool and crisp, are breathable, durable, and feel natural against your skin,” agrees Decesare. “They typically have a tighter weave and lower thread count, making them both breathable and very lightweight. They are also absorbent, wick away moisture from the skin, and tend to soften up over time.”</p><h3>Are cotton or bamboo sheets more cooling?</h3><p>“Both cotton and bamboo sheets can be cooling, but bamboo sheets are known for their superior moisture-wicking abilities, making them potentially more cooling than cotton sheets,” says Smith. The <a rel=alternate href=#>best bamboo sheets</a> for hot sleepers are usually made with a percale weave, but your personal preferences may vary.</p><h3>What bedding is best for night sweats?</h3><p>“Preventing night sweats starts with your foundation—that is, what’s right underneath you as you sleep,” says Golub. “Consider cotton, linen, bamboo, or lyocell. For cotton specifically, percale tends to be the coolest weave, and a thread count between 200 and 400 is ideal for maximum comfort.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lk6S8rbXNoGSsoJWawbR7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./all-things-go-festival-new-york-buy-tickets-online-1236034888.html><span>←</span><span>All Things Go: How to Buy Tickets to New Yorks Female-Forward Festival, Featuring Chappell</span></a>
