This past Saturday, just as&nbsp;I had settled down with our baby for a&nbsp;nap, my&nbsp;mother-in-law arrived. I&nbsp;had barely fallen asleep when she and my&nbsp;husband entered our bedroom. I&nbsp;woke up&nbsp;to&nbsp;my&nbsp;husband adjusting my&nbsp;shirt, telling&nbsp;me, “Hey, mum’s here to&nbsp;see&nbsp;us.”</p><p>I&nbsp;responded, “I&nbsp;just got the baby to&nbsp;sleep, so&nbsp;now’s not a&nbsp;good time.” He&nbsp;whispered back, “Babe, she drove two hours to&nbsp;see&nbsp;us. You can nap later.” We’ve had countless talks about this, so&nbsp;I was annoyed and told him to&nbsp;leave the room.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/327/9db/f0eec75924ae13d27ba7ce9e1c.jpg><p>My&nbsp;mother-in-law chimed&nbsp;in, trying to&nbsp;get me&nbsp;out of&nbsp;bed, saying she hadn’t come all this way for nothing. I&nbsp;lost my&nbsp;patience and told her, “Actually, you did, because we’re not getting up&nbsp;for a&nbsp;surprise visit. Please leave.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8af/124/3229b55a9682c9e86fff899e86.jpg><p>My&nbsp;husband, looking embarrassed, escorted his mom out as&nbsp;she muttered about <a href=# title=respect data-link=tag>respect</a>. Soon after, I&nbsp;heard the front door slam shut. I&nbsp;went back to&nbsp;sleep and woke up&nbsp;later to&nbsp;find my&nbsp;husband in&nbsp;the kitchen, clearly upset. When he&nbsp;saw&nbsp;me, he&nbsp;exploded, criticizing me&nbsp;for embarrassing him and arguing that a&nbsp;brief meeting wouldn’t have been too much to&nbsp;ask.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/83e/7b6/861b265110aa1630ad513d43f4.jpg><p>I&nbsp;stood my&nbsp;ground, insisting on&nbsp;being informed about visitors beforehand. Now he&nbsp;claims he&nbsp;did tell&nbsp;me, which isn’t true, and he’s upset that his mother’s long drive was for nothing. But I&nbsp;was exhausted and needed that rest, and I’m sticking to&nbsp;my&nbsp;boundaries.</p><p><strong>Thank you for trusting&nbsp;us. We&nbsp;do&nbsp;love helping our readers. Here are possible solutions that you might want to&nbsp;consider.</strong></p><p><h2>Ask your husband to&nbsp;plan the visits accordingly.</h2></p><p>Suggest that your husband use a&nbsp;shared calendar or&nbsp;an&nbsp;app to&nbsp;keep track of&nbsp;when guests are coming. This way, he’ll remember to&nbsp;tell you, and you’ll get a&nbsp;heads-up. If&nbsp;<a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> visits are frequent, think about making a&nbsp;special routine that’s fun but not too tiring. Maybe set up&nbsp;a&nbsp;special spot for guests or&nbsp;plan some simple activities to&nbsp;do&nbsp;together.</p><p><h2>Schedule specific days per week for visits.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6b2/683/deebd65550aa320ddda15f6438.jpg><p>Talk with your husband about picking certain days or&nbsp;times that work best for visits. This helps both of&nbsp;you plan better. If&nbsp;a&nbsp;visit comes at&nbsp;a&nbsp;bad time, try suggesting a&nbsp;quick video call instead. This way, you can still catch up&nbsp;with family without it&nbsp;being too tiring for you.</p><p><h2>Include your family when discussing the plans.</h2></p><p>If&nbsp;you can, talk to&nbsp;your mother-in-law and other family members about this. Explaining directly how sudden visits disrupt your routine might help them understand and be&nbsp;more considerate.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLZuvsSfrKydlGLBsHnSnpxmpaliuqq4jJucnJmlqLJutYywmKxlo6GyprzIp55mr5mptW652GaZmpqpYoVyhZdqb2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-can-men-style-their-suits-in-a-modern-fashionable-way-in-2024.html><span>←</span><span>How can men style their suits in a modern, fashionable way in 2024?</span></a>
