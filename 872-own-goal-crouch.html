Unsurprisingly, but unfortunately for Crouch, he is attracting the attention of TellYouGov users, or ‘tyggers’, for all the wrong reasons; as reflected in his significantly negative sentiment score of -77.</p><p>His rise up the leaderboard follows reports in a Sunday newspaper that the England international cheated on his fiancée, model Abigail Clancy, with a prostitute whilst on a stag weekend in Spain. Many tyggers have expressed their disgust at Crouch’s ‘disappointing behaviour’, with one believing he ‘may have made the biggest mistake of his life’. There have also been calls for Miss Clancy to leave the footballer. One tygger suggested that ‘Abbey (as she is often known) would be better off without him’.</p><p class=heading>‘Overpaid and overrated’</p><p>For others, Crouch is just the latest in a long and disappointing line of footballers who are alleged to have cheated on their partners. One described him as ‘another overpaid, overrated footballer, caught cheating’, and another exclaimed ‘they’re all at it!’ One summarised: ‘give them less money and less publicity, and we may see great football again’. Another simply asked ‘when will these footballers learn?’</p><p>Clearly, the allegations of Crouch’s unfaithfulness have had a negative impact on the football star’s reputation among interested tyggers. With the new Premier League football season beginning on Saturday, it remains to be seen whether Crouch can reverse the negative impact on his reputation and begin receiving attention for the right reason – the quality of his football.</p><p><a href=#>Have your say: The TellYouGov keyword for this topic is 'Peter Crouch'</a></p><p><a href=#>What is TellYouGov?</a><br><a href=#>What do the numbers on the TellYouGov leaderboard mean?</a><br><a href=#>Click here to see the LIVE TellYouGov leaderboard</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkwLCvyJ6rsmeRp8Gqr8ueqmhwZ2d6sMPNZp6omZxisLO71Jyf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./0-26174-1982219-00-html.html><span>←</span><span>Monday, Apr. 26, 2010 - Quotes of the Day</span></a>
